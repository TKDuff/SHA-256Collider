The Director of Companies was our captain and our host.
Marlow sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast.
We exchanged a few words lazily.
Afterwards there was silence on board the yacht.
We felt meditative, and fit for nothing but placid staring.
It had known the ships and the men.
His remark did not seem at all surprising.
It was just like Marlow.
It was accepted in silence.
No Falernian wine here, no going ashore.
They must have been dying like flies here.
Oh, yes—he did it.
They were men enough to face the darkness.
There’s no initiation either into such mysteries.
What saves us is efficiency—the devotion to efficiency.
But these chaps were not much account, really.
What redeems it is the idea only.
He broke off.
No, not very clear.
And yet it seemed to throw a kind of light.
But the ships wouldn’t even look at me.
And I got tired of that game, too.
The glamour’s off.
Other places were scattered about the hemispheres.
I have been in some of them, and...
well, we won’t talk about that.
It had become a place of darkness.
The snake had charmed me.
I am sorry to own I began to worry them.
This was already a fresh departure for me.
So I worried them.
The men said ‘My dear fellow,’ and did nothing.
Then—would you believe it?—I tried the women.
Heavens! Well, you see, the notion drove me.
I had an aunt, a dear enthusiastic soul.
She wrote: ‘It will be delightful.
I am ready to do anything, anything for you.
It is a glorious idea.
Yes, two black hens.
They were all there.
The supernatural being had not been touched after he fell.
A calamity had come to it, sure enough.
The people had vanished.
What became of the hens I don’t know either.
I should think the cause of progress got them, anyhow.
Prejudice no doubt.
I had no difficulty in finding the Company’s offices.
I gave my name, and looked about.
However, I wasn’t going into any of these.
I was going into the yellow.
Dead in the centre.
And the river was there—fascinating—deadly—like a snake.
The great man himself.
Well, I am not going to.
I began to feel slightly uneasy.
The old one sat on her chair.
She glanced at me above the glasses.
The swift and indifferent placidity of that look troubled me.
An eerie feeling came over me.
She seemed uncanny and fateful.
_Ave!_ Old knitter of black wool.
_Morituri te salutant_.
There was yet a visit to the doctor.
He became very cool and collected all at once.
‘And when they come back, too?’ I asked.
‘So you are going out there.
I felt very annoyed.
‘Every doctor should be—a little,’ answered that original, imperturbably.
The mere wealth I leave to others.
‘Avoid irritation more than exposure to the sun.
How do you English say, eh? Good-bye.
In the tropics one must before everything keep calm.’...
He lifted a warning forefinger....
I found her triumphant.
It’s queer how out of touch with truth women are.
I watched the coast.
They were just flung out there, and on we went.
It was paddled by black fellows.
They wanted no excuse for being there.
They were a great comfort to look at.
Something would turn up to scare it away.
Nothing could happen.
It was like a weary pilgrimage amongst hints for nightmares.
We anchored off the seat of the government.
I had my passage on a little sea-going steamer.
‘Been living there?’ he asked.
‘So-o-o!’ he exclaimed.
He shuffled athwart, keeping one eye ahead vigilantly.
‘Don’t be too sure,’ he continued.
He kept on looking out watchfully.
A jetty projected into the river.
‘I will send your things up.
Four boxes did you say? So.
One was off.
I blinked, the path was steep.
No change appeared on the face of the rock.
They were building a railway.
A slight clinking behind me made me turn my head.
It wasn’t a quarry or a sandpit, anyhow.
It was just a hole.
I don’t know.
There wasn’t one that was not broken.
It was a wanton smash-up.
At last I got under the trees.
The work was going on.
They were dying slowly—it was very clear.
These moribund shapes were free as air—and nearly as thin.
Then, glancing down, I saw a face near my hand.
He was amazing, and had a penholder behind his ear.
Moreover, I respected the fellow.
His starched collars and got-up shirt-fronts were achievements of character.
It was difficult.
Sometimes he stood up for exercise.
Kurtz.’ On my asking who Mr.
The sick man was too ill to groan.
The flies buzzed in a great peace.
A caravan had come in.
He rose slowly.
‘What a frightful row,’ he said.
‘No, not yet,’ he answered, with great composure.
‘When you see Mr.
‘Oh, he will go far, very far,’ he began again.
‘He will be a somebody in the Administration before long.
No use telling you much about that.
The population had cleared out a long time ago.
Only here the dwellings were gone, too.
Still I passed through several abandoned villages.
There’s something pathetically childish in the ruins of grass walls.
Camp, cook, sleep, strike camp, march.
A great silence around and above.
Was looking after the upkeep of the road, he declared.
‘To make money, of course.
What do you think?’ he said, scornfully.
The heavy pole had skinned his poor nose.
However, all that is to no purpose.
I was thunderstruck.
All quite correct.
The steamer was sunk.
I had to set about it the very next day.
My first interview with the manager was curious.
He was of middle size and of ordinary build.
He inspired uneasiness.
That was it! Uneasiness.
Not a definite mistrust—just uneasiness—nothing more.
You have no idea how effective such a...
faculty can be.
He had no learning, and no intelligence.
He had served three terms of three years out there...
Jack ashore—with a difference—in externals only.
This one could gather from his casual talk.
He originated nothing, he could keep the routine going—that’s all.
But he was great.
He never gave that secret away.
Perhaps there was nothing within him.
You fancied you had seen things—but the seal was on.
This was the station’s mess-room.
Where he sat was the first place—the rest were nowhere.
One felt this to be his unalterable conviction.
He was neither civil nor uncivil.
He was quiet.
He began to speak as soon as he saw me.
I had been very long on the road.
He could not wait.
Had to start without me.
The up-river stations had to be relieved.
Kurtz, was ill.
Hoped it was not true.
I felt weary and irritable.
Hang Kurtz, I thought.
I interrupted him by saying I had heard of Mr.
Kurtz on the coast.
Then he began again, assuring me Mr.
I interrupted him again.
Being hungry, you know, and kept on my feet too.
I was getting savage.
‘How can I tell?’ I said.
‘Some months,’ he said.
He was a chattering idiot.
I asked myself sometimes what it all meant.
You would think they were praying to it.
Oh, these months! Well, never mind.
Various things happened.
I strolled up.
There was no hurry.
It had been hopeless from the very first.
The shed was already a heap of embers glowing fiercely.
A nigger was being beaten near by.
I wished him a good evening.
The other man remained.
An act of special creation perhaps.
Steal a horse straight out.
He has done it.
Perhaps he can ride.
The background was sombre—almost black.
To my question he said Mr.
‘Tell me, pray,’ said I, ‘who is this Mr.
‘Much obliged,’ I said, laughing.
‘And you are the brickmaker of the Central Station.
Every one knows that.’ He was silent for a while.
‘He is a prodigy,’ he said at last.
‘Lots of them,’ he replied.
He paid no attention.
You are of the new gang—the gang of virtue.
The same people who sent him specially also recommended you.
Oh, don’t say no.
I’ve my own eyes to trust.’ Light dawned upon me.
I nearly burst into a laugh.
‘Do you read the Company’s confidential correspondence?’ I asked.
He hadn’t a word to say.
It was great fun.
The moon had risen.
‘Serve him right.
Transgression—punishment—bang! Pitiless, pitiless.
That’s the only way.
This will prevent all conflagrations for the future.
Ha! Danger—agitation.’ He vanished.
Several had still their staves in their hands.
I felt a hand introducing itself under my arm.
Kurtz long before I can have that pleasure.
Kurtz was in there.
Temperament, I suppose.
He was just a word for me.
He was silent for a while.
It is impossible.
We live, as we dream—alone....
You see me, whom you know....
There was not a word from anybody.
The others might have been asleep, but I was awake.
To get on with the work—to stop the hole.
Rivets I wanted.
Rivets had rolled into the grove of death.
And no rivets.
Kurtz wanted, if he had only known it.
Now letters went to the coast every week....
There was a way—for an intelligent man.
Some even had sat up o’ nights for him.
All this energy was wasted, though.
I clambered on board.
No influential friend would have served me better.
No, I don’t like work.
This was the foreman—a boiler-maker by trade—a good worker.
He was an enthusiast and a connoisseur.
He would rave about pigeons.
It had loops to go over his ears.
Then in a low voice, ‘You...
eh?’ I don’t know why we behaved like lunatics.
I tried a jig.
We capered on the iron deck.
And it moved not.
‘They’ll come in three weeks,’ I said confidently.
But they didn’t.
I had given up worrying myself about the rivets.
I said Hang!—and let things slide.
I wasn’t very interested in him.
It’s incredible.’ ...
‘It _is_ unpleasant,’ grunted the uncle.
Look at the influence that man must have.
It was more than a year ago.
‘Invoice,’ was the reply fired out, so to speak.
They had been talking about Kurtz.
They were at a loss for an adequate motive.
I did not know the motive.
His name, you understand, had not been pronounced once.
And why? You stand the climate—you outlast them all.
‘The extraordinary series of delays is not my fault.
I did my best.’ The fat man sighed.
I could have spat upon their hats.
They were looking on the ground, absorbed in thought.
The other gave a start.
‘Who? I? Oh! Like a charm—like a charm.
But the rest—oh, my goodness! All sick.
Just so,’ grunted the uncle.
You know the foolish notions that come to one sometimes.
I did not inquire.
When I say very soon I mean it comparatively.
An empty stream, a great silence, an impenetrable forest.
The air was warm, thick, heavy, sluggish.
There was no joy in the brilliance of sunshine.
It looked at you with a vengeful aspect.
The inner truth is hidden—luckily, luckily.
I beg your pardon.
It’s a wonder to me yet.
Fine fellows—cannibals—in their place.
Phoo! I can sniff it now.
Where the pilgrims imagined it crawled to I don’t know.
To some place where they expected to get something.
We penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness.
It was very quiet there.
The earth seemed unearthly.
It would come slowly to one.
Principles won’t do.
No; you want a deliberate belief.
This was unexpected.
When deciphered it said: ‘Wood for you.
Something was wrong above.
But what—and how much? That was the question.
We commented adversely upon the imbecility of that telegraphic style.
It was an extraordinary find.
I slipped the book into my pocket.
I started the lame engine ahead.
‘He must be English,’ I said.
It was like watching the last flickers of a life.
But still we crawled.
The manager displayed a beautiful resignation.
This was sensible enough.
Not the faintest sound of any kind could be heard.
A complaining clamour, modulated in savage discords, filled our ears.
‘Will they attack?’ whispered an awed voice.
‘We will be all butchered in this fog,’ murmured another.
‘Aha!’ I said, just for good fellowship’s sake.
You can see how _that_ worked.
Perhaps I had a little fever, too.
One can’t live with one’s finger everlastingly on one’s pulse.
Sad, but true.
That was his restraint.
I knew, and he knew, that it was impossible.
Of course I made no move.
I had no mind for a smash-up.
You couldn’t imagine a more deadly place for a shipwreck.
‘Well, I must defer to your judgment.
You are captain,’ he said with marked civility.
The thick fog was one.
They had not the fierce character boding immediate hostile intention.
I delivered a regular lecture.
My dear boys, it was no good bothering.
It felt like it, too—choking, warm, stifling.
I didn’t know either channel, of course.
Above the bush the trees stood in serried ranks.
This steamboat was exactly like a decked scow.
All these were always thrown open, of course.
At night I slept, or tried to, on the couch.
I was amazed.
We cleared the snag clumsily.
‘Steer her straight,’ I said to the helmsman.
‘Keep quiet!’ I said in a fury.
I darted out.
What? Another snag! A fusillade burst out under my feet.
I swore at it.
Now I couldn’t see the ripple or the snag either.
The bush began to howl.
The fusillade burst out again.
‘Good God!’ he said, glaring at the wounded man.
The lustre of inquiring glance faded swiftly into vacant glassiness.
‘Can you steer?’ I asked the agent eagerly.
‘He is dead,’ murmured the fellow, immensely impressed.
‘And by the way, I suppose Mr.
I thought, ‘By Jove! it’s all over.
Good Lord! mustn’t a man ever—Here, give me some tobacco....
The match went out.
Absurd! he cried.
This is the worst of trying to tell....
I am, upon the whole, proud of my fortitude.
Of course I was wrong.
The privilege was waiting for me.
Oh, yes, I heard more than enough.
And I was right, too.
He was very little more than a voice.
Oh, she had to be out of it.
You should have heard the disinterred body of Mr.
And the lofty frontal bone of Mr.
He was its spoiled and pampered favourite.
Ivory? I should think so.
Heaps of it, stacks of it.
The old mud shanty was bursting with it.
‘Mostly fossil,’ the manager had remarked, disparagingly.
Kurtz from his fate.
Everything belonged to him—but that was a trifle.
That was the reflection that made you creepy all over.
You can’t understand.
But most of us are neither one nor the other.
And that’s difficult enough.
Kurtz—for the shade of Mr.
This was because it could speak English to me.
His mother was half-English, his father was half-French.
And he had written it, too.
I’ve seen it.
I’ve read it.
But it was a beautiful piece of writing.
From that point he soared and took me with him.
The peroration was magnificent, though difficult to remember, you know.
It made me tingle with enthusiasm.
But then, you see, I can’t choose.
He won’t be forgotten.
Whatever he was, he was not common.
It was a kind of partnership.
Poor fool! If he had only left that shutter alone.
Then without more ado I tipped him overboard.
Embalm it, maybe.
This I did directly the simple funeral was over.
‘What’s this?’ I asked.
He clapped his hands in wonder.
‘The station!’ he cried.
I edged in at once, still going half-speed.
The rails, or whatever there had been between, had disappeared.
Of course the forest surrounded all that.
‘We have been attacked,’ screamed the manager.
‘I know—I know.
It’s all right.
He looked like a harlequin.
‘You English?’ he asked, all smiles.
‘Are you?’ I shouted from the wheel.
Then he brightened up.
‘Never mind!’ he cried encouragingly.
‘Are we in time?’ I asked.
‘I say, I don’t like this.
These natives are in the bush,’ I said.
He assured me earnestly it was all right.
They are simple people,’ he repeated.
‘Don’t you talk with Mr.
Kurtz?’ I said.
son of an arch-priest...
Government of Tambov...
He made a point of that.
‘You can never tell! Here I met Mr.
Kurtz,’ he said, youthfully solemn and reproachful.
I held my tongue after that.
‘I am not so young as I look.
I am twenty-five,’ he said.
Good old Dutchman, Van Shuyten.
I hope he got it.
And for the rest I don’t care.
I had some wood stacked for you.
That was my old house.
Did you see?’ I gave him Towson’s book.
‘You made notes in Russian?’ I asked.
‘I thought they were written in cipher,’ I said.
He laughed, then became serious.
‘Did they want to kill you?’ I asked.
‘Oh, no!’ he cried, and checked himself.
‘Why did they attack us?’ I pursued.
He nodded a nod full of mystery and wisdom.
III I looked at him, lost in astonishment.
His very existence was improbable, inexplicable, and altogether bewildering.
He was an insoluble problem.
I can manage.
I was seduced into something like admiration—like envy.
Glamour urged him on, glamour kept him unscathed.
I did not envy him his devotion to Kurtz, though.
He had not meditated over it.
‘I forgot there was such a thing as sleep.
The night did not seem to last an hour.
‘It isn’t what you think,’ he cried, almost passionately.
‘It was in general.
He made me see things—things.’ He threw his arms up.
On the contrary.
‘To speak plainly, he raided the country,’ I said.
He fidgeted a little.
‘They adored him,’ he said.
He could be very terrible.
You can’t judge Mr.
Kurtz as you would an ordinary man.
You see I used to shoot game for them.
Well, he wanted it, and wouldn’t hear reason.
And it was true, too.
I gave him the ivory.
What did I care! But I didn’t clear out.
I couldn’t leave him.
He had his second illness then.
This man suffered too much.
He hated all this, and somehow he couldn’t get away.
He protested indignantly.
Kurtz couldn’t be mad.
However he had got much worse suddenly.
I was not so shocked as you may think.
I am not disclosing any trade secrets.
In fact, the manager said afterwards that Mr.
Kurtz’s methods had ruined the district.
They only showed that Mr.
Whether he knew of this deficiency himself I can’t say.
The admirer of Mr.
Kurtz was a bit crestfallen.
Kurtz gave the word.
His ascendancy was extraordinary.
They would crawl....
Kurtz,’ I shouted.
The young man looked at me with surprise.
I suppose it did not occur to him that Mr.
Kurtz was no idol of mine.
If it had come to crawling before Mr.
I shocked him excessively by laughing.
‘Well, and you?’ I said.
‘I! I! I am a simple man.
I have no great thoughts.
I want nothing from anybody.
‘I don’t understand,’ he groaned.
I had no hand in all this.
I have no abilities.
He was shamefully abandoned.
A man like this, with such ideas.
Not a living soul was seen on the shore.
The bushes did not rustle.
He looked at least seven feet long.
A deep voice reached me faintly.
He must have been shouting.
He fell back suddenly.
His hand roamed feebly amongst these papers.
It was not so much the exhaustion of disease.
He did not seem in pain.
These special recommendations were turning up again.
I followed the direction of his glance.
Her long shadow fell to the water’s edge.
The young fellow by my side growled.
The pilgrims murmured at my back.
A formidable silence hung over the scene.
I wasn’t decent.
I don’t understand the dialect of this tribe.
I don’t understand....
No—it’s too much for me.
Don’t tell me.
Save _me!_ Why, I’ve had to save you.
You are interrupting my plans now.
I’ll carry my ideas out yet—I will return.
I’ll show you what can be done.
You with your little peddling notions—you are interfering with me.
I will return.
I....’ The manager came out.
‘He is very low, very low,’ he said.
Kurtz has done more harm than good to the Company.
Cautiously, cautiously—that’s my principle.
We must be cautious yet.
The district is closed to us for a time.
Deplorable! Upon the whole, the trade will suffer.
‘No method at all,’ I murmured after a while.
‘Exactly,’ he exulted.
‘I anticipated this.
Shows a complete want of judgment.
‘Nevertheless I think Mr.
Kurtz is a remarkable man,’ I said with emphasis.
I had turned to the wilderness really, not to Mr.
The Russian tapped me on the shoulder.
Kurtz’s reputation.’ I waited.
For him evidently Mr.
Kurtz was one of the immortals.
‘Well!’ said I at last, ‘speak out.
As it happens, I am Mr.
But I don’t understand these matters.
I am a simple man.
I could not stop him.
I am off.
‘Ah! I’ll never, never meet such a man again.
‘Oh, he enlarged my mind!’ ‘Good-bye,’ said I.
He shook hands and vanished in the night.
Kurtz’s adorers were keeping their uneasy vigil.
I glanced casually into the little cabin.
A light was burning within, but Mr.
Kurtz was not there.
I did not betray Mr.
I strode rapidly with clenched fists.
I don’t know.
I had some imbecile thoughts.
Such silly things—you know.
I kept to the track though—then stopped to listen.
I was strangely cocksure of everything that night.
It was by no means over yet.
‘Go away—hide yourself,’ he said, in that profound tone.
It was very awful.
I glanced back.
We were within thirty yards from the nearest fire.
It had horns—antelope horns, I think—on its head.
Some sorcerer, some witch-man, no doubt: it looked fiendlike enough.
‘Do you know what you are doing?’ I whispered.
‘I had immense plans,’ he muttered irresolutely.
‘I will throttle you for good,’ I corrected myself.
He had kicked himself loose of the earth.
And I wasn’t arguing with a lunatic either.
But his soul was mad.
He struggled with himself, too.
I saw it—I heard it.
Lying on the couch, he stared through the open shutter.
‘Do you understand this?’ I asked.
I pulled the string time after time.
I was, so to speak, numbered with the dead.
Sometimes he was contemptibly childish.
I looked ahead—piloting.
There was a silence.
This delay was the first thing that shook Kurtz’s confidence.
‘Keep this for me,’ he said.
There was nothing more.
It’s a duty.’ His was an impenetrable darkness.
Oh, I wasn’t touched.
I was fascinated.
It was as though a veil had been rent.
I remained, and went on with my dinner.
I believe I was considered brutally callous.
However, I did not eat much.
The voice was gone.
And then they very nearly buried me.
I did not.
I have wrestled with death.
It is the most unexciting contest you can imagine.
He had something to say.
He said it.
He had summed up—he had judged.
‘The horror!’ He was a remarkable man.
Better his cry—much better.
They trespassed upon my thoughts.
I daresay I was not very well at that time.
He invoked then the name of science.
‘It would be an incalculable loss if,’ etc., etc.
‘Expect nothing else,’ I said.
He electrified large meetings.
He had faith—don’t you see?—he had the faith.
He could get himself to believe anything—anything.
‘Any party,’ answered the other.
‘He was an—an—extremist.’ Did I not think so? I assented.
Curiosity? Yes; and also some other feeling perhaps.
I don’t defend myself.
I don’t know.
I can’t tell.
But I went.
The Company did not pay for it.
I collected it myself at a very great personal risk.
It is a difficult case.
He wanted no more than justice—no more than justice.
The tall marble fireplace had a cold and monumental whiteness.
A high door opened—closed.
She was in mourning.
Their glance was guileless, profound, confident, and trustful.
For her he had died only yesterday.
Do you understand? I saw them together—I heard them together.
She motioned me to a chair.
We sat down.
‘Intimacy grows quickly out there,’ I said.
Was it?’ ‘He was a remarkable man,’ I said, unsteadily.
I knew him best.’ ‘You knew him best,’ I repeated.
And perhaps she did.
‘You were his friend,’ she went on.
‘His friend,’ she repeated, a little louder.
It is not pride....
The darkness deepened.
He wasn’t rich enough or something.
‘But you have heard him! You know!’ she cried.
‘I have been very happy—very fortunate—very proud,’ she went on.
Too happy for a little while.
I rose, too.
‘No!’ she cried.
You know what vast plans he had.
Something must remain.
‘And his example,’ she whispered to herself.
‘Men looked up to him—his goodness shone in every act.
His example—’ ‘True,’ I said; ‘his example, too.
Yes, his example.
I forgot that.’ ‘But I do not.
I cannot—I cannot believe—not yet.
Never see him! I saw him clearly enough then.
My anger subsided before a feeling of infinite pity.
‘Everything that could be done—’ I mumbled.
‘Don’t,’ I said, in a muffled voice.
I—I have mourned so long in silence—in silence....
Nobody near to understand him as I would have understood.
‘Repeat them,’ she murmured in a heart-broken tone.
‘I knew it—I was sure!’...
She was sure.
But nothing happened.
The heavens do not fall for such a trifle.
I could not tell her.
It would have been too dark—too dark altogether....
Nobody moved for a time.
I raised my head.
Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith.
Oh! Don’t cut my throat, sir, I pleaded in terror.
Pray don’t do it, sir.
Tell us your name! said the man.
Quick! Pip, sir.
Once more, said the man, staring at me.
Give it mouth! Pip.
Show us where you live, said the man.
There was nothing in them but a piece of bread.
Now lookee here! said the man.
Where’s your mother? There, sir! said I.
There, sir! I timidly explained.
That’s my mother.
Oh! said he, coming back.
Ha! he muttered then, considering.
Joe Gargery,—wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith, sir.
Blacksmith, eh? said he.
And looked down at his leg.
You know what a file is? Yes, sir.
And you know what wittles is? Yes, sir.
You get me a file.
He tilted me again.
And you get me wittles.
He tilted me again.
You bring ’em both to me.
He tilted me again.
Or I’ll have your heart and liver out.
He tilted me again.
Now, I ain’t alone, as you may think I am.
That young man hears the words I speak.
I said so, and he took me down.
I wish I was a frog.
My sister, Mrs.
My sister, Mrs.
And she’s out now, making it a baker’s dozen.
I took the advice.
My sister, Mrs.
Where have you been, you young monkey? said Mrs.
Joe, stamping her foot.
Churchyard! repeated my sister.
Who brought you up by hand? You did, said I.
I whimpered, I don’t know.
_I_ don’t! said my sister.
I’d never do it again! I know that.
Hah! said Mrs.
Joe, restoring Tickler to his station.
Churchyard, indeed! You may well say churchyard, you two.
I knew Mrs.
Pip, old chap! You’ll do yourself a mischief.
It’ll stick somewhere.
You can’t have chawed it, Pip.
Manners is manners, but still your elth’s your elth.
The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs.
There’s another conwict off.
What does that mean, Joe? said I.
Joe, who always took explanations upon herself, said, snappishly, Escaped.
Administering the definition like Tar-water.
And they fired warning of him.
And now it appears they’re firing warning of another.
_Who’s_ firing? said I.
Ask no questions, and you’ll be told no lies.
But she never was polite unless there was company.
Therefore, I naturally pointed to Mrs.
But I could make nothing of the word.
From the Hulks! Oh-h! said I, looking at Joe.
And please, what’s Hulks? said I.
Hulks are prison-ships, right ’cross th’ meshes.
We always used that name for marshes, in our country.
It was too much for Mrs.
Joe, who immediately rose.
I was clearly on my way there.
It was a rimy morning, and very damp.
This was very disagreeable to a guilty mind.
He was awfully cold, to be sure.
What’s in the bottle, boy? said he.
Brandy, said I.
I think you have got the ague, said I.
I’m much of your opinion, boy, said he.
It’s bad about here, I told him.
I’ll beat the shivers so far, I’ll bet you.
And he smeared his ragged rough sleeve over his eyes.
Thankee, my boy.
There’s no more to be got where that came from.
The young man.
That you spoke of.
That was hid with you.
Oh ah! he returned, with something like a gruff laugh.
Him? Yes, yes! _He_ don’t want no wittles.
I thought he looked as if he did, said I.
Looked? When? Just now.
Why, see now! said he.
Show me the way he went.
I’ll pull him down, like a bloodhound.
And where the deuce ha’ _you_ been? was Mrs.
Joe’s Christmas salutation, when I and my conscience showed ourselves.
I said I had been down to hear the Carols.
Ah! well! observed Mrs.
You might ha’ done worse.
Not a doubt of that I thought.
Joe was in a cross temper.
In the meantime, Mrs.
The terrors that had assailed me whenever Mrs.
Hubble the wheelwright and Mrs.
Hubble; and Uncle Pumblechook (Joe’s uncle, but Mrs.
The dinner hour was half-past one.
And still, not a word of the robbery.
Wopsle, next to Mr.
Hubble, and last of all to Uncle Pumblechook.
Every Christmas Day, Mrs.
Hubble than in other company.
I remember Mrs.
But they wouldn’t leave me alone.
It began the moment we sat down to dinner.
Especially, said Mr.
Hubble tersely solved it by saying, Naterally wicious.
A little later on in the dinner, Mr.
True again, said Uncle Pumblechook.
That’s what’s wanted.
Many a moral for the young, returned Mr.
Swine, pursued Mr.
Or girl, suggested Mr.
Of course, or girl, Mr.
Hubble, assented Mr.
Wopsle, rather irritably, but there is no girl present.
Besides, said Mr.
Joe gave me some more gravy.
Well, but I mean a four-footed Squeaker, said Mr.
Wopsle, nodding towards the dish.
But I don’t mean in that form, sir, returned Mr.
Would he have been doing that? No, he wouldn’t.
No bringing up by hand then.
Hubble, commiserating my sister.
Perhaps, they became the restless people they were, in consequence.
Yet, said Mr.
All this time Mrs.
I couldn’t keep my eyes off him.
I held on tight, while Mrs.
Joe and Joe ran to him.
I knew he would be worse by and by.
Tar! cried my sister, in amazement.
For the time being at least, I was saved.
Pumblechook partook of pudding.
All partook of pudding.
The course terminated, and Mr.
The company murmured their compliments.
My sister went out to get it.
I heard her steps proceed to the pantry.
I saw Mr.
Pumblechook balance his knife.
I saw reawakening appetite in the Roman nostrils of Mr.
I heard Mr.
It’s just gone half past two.
We begin to close in upon ’em about dusk.
A little before dusk, my orders are.
Convicts, sergeant? asked Mr.
Wopsle, in a matter-of-course way.
Ay! returned the sergeant, two.
Nobody thought of me.
Now, blacksmith! If you’re ready, his Majesty the King is.
Pumblechook said, sharply, Give him wine, Mum.
Good stuff, eh, sergeant? said Mr.
D’ye think so? said Mr.
Pumblechook, with his former laugh.
Have another glass! With you.
Hob and nob, returned the sergeant.
I noticed that Mr.
Even I got some.
Pumblechook and Mr.
Wopsle said he would go, if Joe would.
His men resumed their muskets and fell in.
I could see none, I could hear none.
It was repeated.
Wopsle (who was a bad judge) agreed.
I took him.
He knows it.
That’s enough for me.
Tried to murder him? said my convict, disdainfully.
He’s a gentleman, if you please, this villain.
Now, the Hulks has got its gentleman again, through me.
Lookee here! said my convict to the sergeant.
He lies! said my convict, with fierce energy.
He’s a liar born, and he’ll die a liar.
I defy him to do it.
Do you see him? pursued my convict.
He never looked at me.
Enough of this parley, said the sergeant.
Light those torches.
All right, said the sergeant.
Don’t straggle, my man.
Close up here.
I could see nothing else but black darkness.
My convict never looked at me, except that once.
It may prevent some persons laying under suspicion alonger me.
I know, but this is another pint, a separate matter.
A man can’t starve; at least _I_ can’t.
You mean stole, said the sergeant.
And I’ll tell you where from.
From the blacksmith’s.
Halloa! said the sergeant, staring at Joe.
Halloa, Pip! said Joe, staring at me.
Joe called Pompeyed, or (as I render it) pampered.
She rented a small cottage, and Mr.
There was a fiction that Mr.
Wopsle examined the scholars once a quarter.
Biddy was Mr.
This description must be received with a week-day limitation.
On Sundays, she went to church elaborated.
Astonishing! said Joe, when I had finished.
You ARE a scholar.
I don’t spell it at all, said Joe.
But supposing you did? It _can’t_ be supposed, said Joe.
Tho’ I’m uncommon fond of reading, too.
Are you, Joe? On-common.
And then he took us home and hammered us.
I made it, said Joe, my own self.
I made it in a moment.
She were in poor elth, and quite broke.
So am I, returned Joe, catching me up.
_I_ am glad I think so, Pip.
Joe mustn’t see too much of what we’re up to.
And why on the sly? I’ll tell you why, Pip.
Your sister is given to government.
Given to government, said Joe.
Which I meantersay the government of you and myself.
Stay a bit.
This was market-day, and Mrs.
Joe was out on one of these expeditions.
We got a chair out, ready for Mrs.
Now, said Mrs.
But I have my fears.
She ain’t in that line, Mum, said Mr.
She knows better.
Well? said my sister, in her snappish way.
And she is a she, I suppose? said my sister.
Unless you call Miss Havisham a he.
Miss Havisham, up town? said Joe.
Is there any Miss Havisham down town? returned my sister.
She wants this boy to go and play there.
And of course he’s going.
Well to be sure! said Joe, astounded.
I was then delivered over to Mr.
The same opportunity served me for noticing that Mr.
I considered Mr.
Pumblechook wretched company.
This, said Mr.
Pumblechook, is Pip.
Oh! she said.
Ah! said the girl; but you see she don’t.
It has more than one, then, miss? One more.
Enough House, said I; that’s a curious name, miss.
Yes, she replied; but it meant more than it said.
But don’t loiter, boy.
I answered, more in shyness than politeness, After you, miss.
This was very uncomfortable, and I was half afraid.
No glimpse of daylight was to be seen in it.
Her shoes were white.
I should have cried out, if I could.
Who is it? said the lady at the table.
Pumblechook’s boy, ma’am.
Come nearer; let me look at you.
Look at me, said Miss Havisham.
I am tired, said Miss Havisham.
Call Estella, she repeated, flashing a look at me.
You can do that.
At the door.
Let me see you play cards with this boy.
Nothing but beggar my neighbour, miss.
Beggar him, said Miss Havisham to Estella.
So we sat down to cards.
She won the game, and I dealt.
Tell me in my ear, said Miss Havisham, bending down.
Anything else? I think she is very pretty.
Anything else? I think she is very insulting.
You shall go soon, said Miss Havisham, aloud.
Play the game out.
When shall I have you here again? said Miss Havisham.
Let me think.
Come again after six days.
You hear? Yes, ma’am.
Estella, take him down.
My opinion of those accessories was not favourable.
My sister’s bringing up had made me sensitive.
But she seemed to be everywhere.
Why don’t you cry? Because I don’t want to.
You do, said she.
I went straight to Mr.
Pretty well? Mr.
Pretty well is no answer.
Pumblechook interposed with No! Don’t lose your temper.
Boy! What like is Miss Havisham? Mr.
Very tall and dark, I told him.
Is she, uncle? asked my sister.
Good! said Mr.
She was sitting, I answered, in a black velvet coach.
Pumblechook and Mrs.
And we all had cake and wine on gold plates.
Was anybody else there? asked Mr.
Four dogs, said I.
Large or small? Immense, said I.
And they fought for veal-cutlets out of a silver basket.
Pumblechook and Mrs.
Joe stared at one another again, in utter amazement.
In Miss Havisham’s room.
They stared again.
But there weren’t any horses to it.
Can this be possible, uncle? asked Mrs.
My opinion is, it’s a sedan-chair.
Did you ever see her in it, uncle? asked Mrs.
Don’t say you don’t know _that_, Mum.
Howsever, the boy went there to play.
Yes, said I.
And then we all waved our swords and hurrahed.
Swords! repeated my sister.
And I saw pistols in it,—and jam,—and pills.
That’s true, Mum, said Mr.
Pumblechook, with a grave nod.
My sister stood out for property.
So he went.
Then tell us.
A dog? said Joe.
Don’t you tell no more of ’em, Pip.
You are oncommon in some things.
You’re oncommon small.
Likewise you’re a oncommon scholar.
No, I am ignorant and backward, Joe.
I have learnt next to nothing, Joe.
You think much of me.
It’s only that.
(I’m sorry there weren’t a flag, Pip).
Which this to you the true friend say.
You are not angry with me, Joe? No, old chap.
But it is the same with any life.
The Educational scheme or Course established by Mr.
Wopsle’s great-aunt may be resolved into the following synopsis.
As soon as this volume began to circulate, Mr.
To the Three Jolly Bargemen, therefore, I directed my steps.
Wopsle and a stranger.
I said it, you know, said Joe.
What’ll you drink, Mr.
Come! Put a name to it, Mr.
I wouldn’t wish to be stiff company, said Joe.
Rum, repeated the stranger.
And will the other gentleman originate a sentiment.
Rum, said Mr.
Three Rums! cried the stranger, calling to the landlord.
Our clerk at church.
Most marshes is solitary, said Joe.
No doubt, no doubt.
And we don’t find _them_, easy.
Seems you have been out after such? asked the stranger.
Once, returned Joe.
Wopsle, and Pip.
Didn’t us, Pip? Yes, Joe.
What is it you call him? Pip, said Joe.
Christened Pip? No, not christened Pip.
No, he ain’t.
Nevvy? said the strange man.
What the Blue Blazes is he? asked the stranger.
Having his hand in, Mr.
And here I may remark that when Mr.
I sat gazing at him, spell-bound.
Stop half a moment, Mr.
Gargery, said the strange man.
Yours! said he.
Mind! Your own.
He gave Joe good-night, and he gave Mr.
A bad un, I’ll be bound, said Mrs.
But what’s this? said Mrs.
Joe, throwing down the shilling and catching up the paper.
I was haunted by the file too.
This was my homely thought, as I contemplated the box-tree.
There were three ladies in the room and one gentleman.
I cried about it from breakfast till dinner.
I injured my digestion.
_He_ paid for them, did he not? asked Estella.
_I_ bought them.
Am I pretty? Yes; I think you are very pretty.
Not so much so? No.
Now? said she.
Because you are going to tell upstairs.
Is that it? No, said I, that’s not it.
A boy, said Estella.
Boy of the neighbourhood? Hey? said he.
Yes, sir, said I.
Well! Behave yourself.
I don’t want to know.
Not at cards again? she demanded, with a searching look.
Yes, ma’am; I could do that, if I was wanted.
They shall come and look at me here.
It’s a great cake.
Dear Miss Havisham, said Miss Sarah Pocket.
How well you look! I do not, returned Miss Havisham.
I am yellow skin and bone.
Nothing worth mentioning, replied Camilla.
Then don’t think of me, retorted Miss Havisham.
I am sure I wish it could be so.
Hem! Thinking is easy enough, said the grave lady.
What is easier, you know? assented Miss Sarah Pocket.
Here another burst of feeling.
There’s Matthew! said Camilla.
The bare idea! Mr.
Camilla interposing, as Mrs.
I don’t suffer it to be spoken of.
It and I have worn away together.
I remained quiet.
Estella returned, and she too remained quiet.
This pale young gentleman quickly disappeared, and reappeared beside me.
Who let _you_ in? said he.
Who gave you leave to prowl about? Miss Estella.
Come and fight, said the pale young gentleman.
I ought to give you a reason for fighting, too.
Laws of the game! said he.
Available for both, he said, placing these against the wall.
His spirit inspired me with great respect.
Come here! You may kiss me, if you like.
I kissed her cheek as she turned it to me.
And behold! nothing came of the late struggle.
In these discussions, Joe bore no part.
Joe Gargery, ma’am.
You had better be apprenticed at once.
Then let him come.
Let him come soon, and come along with you.
I followed next to her, and Joe came last.
Oh! said she to Joe.
Well! said Miss Havisham.
Have you brought his indentures with you? asked Miss Havisham.
There are five-and-twenty guineas in this bag.
Give it to your master, Pip.
Good-bye, Pip! said Miss Havisham.
Let them out, Estella.
Am I to come again, Miss Havisham? I asked.
Gargery is your master now.
Well? cried my sister, addressing us both at once.
Of ladies’ company, said Joe.
And drew a long breath.
Well! cried my sister, with a mollified glance at Mr.
Joe was going to break out, but Joe went on.
What she giv’, said Joe, she giv’ to his friends.
Gargery.’ Them were her words; ‘Mrs.
And how much have you got? asked my sister, laughing.
They’d say, returned my sister, curtly, pretty well.
Not too much, but pretty well.
It’s more than that, then, said Joe.
Why, you don’t mean to say— began my sister.
Yes I do, Mum, said Pumblechook; but wait a bit.
Go on, Joseph.
Well, then, said Joe, It’s more than twenty pound.
This boy must be bound, out of hand.
That’s _my_ way.
Bound out of hand.
Never mind me, Mum, returned that diabolical cornchandler.
A pleasure’s a pleasure all the world over.
But this boy, you know; we must have him bound.
I said I’d see to it—to tell you the truth.
That, rather late in the evening Mr.
I had liked it once, but once was not now.
Within a single year all this was changed.
The change was made in me; the thing was done.
Well or ill done, excusably or inexcusably, it was done.
As I was getting too big for Mr.
Wopsle’s great-aunt’s room, my education under that preposterous female terminated.
In my hunger for information, I made proposals to Mr.
Wopsle in his poetic fury had severely mauled me.
Whatever I acquired, I tried to impart to Joe.
Dear fellow, I hope he did.
But in regard to wisiting Miss Havisham.
She might think you wanted something,—expected something of her.
And she might credit it.
Similarly she mightn’t.
I heard her.
ALL, Joe repeated, very emphatically.
I tell you, I heard her.
Yes, old chap.
No, I would _not_.
I never thought of making Miss Havisham any present.
I know, Joe, I know.
It was a slip of mine.
By these conditions I promised to abide.
This morose journeyman had no liking for me.
As to Pip, he’s going up town, said Joe.
Two can go up town.
Tain’t only one wot can go up town.
Don’t lose your temper, said Joe.
Shall if I like, growled Orlick.
Some and their uptowning! Now, master! Come.
No favouring in this shop.
Ah! I am all right, said gruff Old Orlick.
Now! You’re a foul shrew, Mother Gargery, growled the journeyman.
Miss Sarah Pocket came to the gate.
How, then? You here again? said Miss Pocket.
Everything was unchanged, and Miss Havisham was alone.
Well? said she, fixing her eyes upon me.
I hope you want nothing? You’ll get nothing.
No indeed, Miss Havisham.
There, there! with the old restless fingers.
She spared me the trouble of considering, by dismissing me.
This, however, was a mere question of length and wearisomeness.
Wopsle on the walk home.
Halloa! we said, stopping.
Orlick there? Ah! he answered, slouching out.
You are late, I remarked.
Orlick not unnaturally answered, Well? And _you_’re late.
We have been, said Mr.
Wopsle, exalted with his late performance,—we have been indulging, Mr.
Orlick, in an intellectual evening.
I come in behind yourself.
By the by, the guns is going again.
At the Hulks? said I.
Ay! There’s some of the birds flown from the cages.
The guns have been going since dark, about.
You’ll hear one presently.
A good night for cutting off in, said Orlick.
I kept myself to myself and my thoughts.
Thus, we came to the village.
So did Orlick, at my side.
I can’t quite understand.
Supposed by convicts.
Somebody has been attacked and hurt.
But not quite, for they never did it.
However, her temper was greatly improved, and she was patient.
Why, of course! cried Biddy, with an exultant face.
Imperceptibly I became conscious of a change in Biddy, however.
But you never turn to at it, Biddy.
In short, whatever I knew, Biddy knew.
Biddy! I exclaimed, in amazement.
Ah, poor thing! replied Biddy.
It was summer-time, and lovely weather.
O, I wouldn’t, if I was you! she returned.
I don’t think it would answer.
I am disgusted with my calling and with my life.
I have never taken to either, since I was bound.
Don’t be absurd.
It scarcely sounded flattering, but I knew she meant well.
I don’t know, I moodily answered.
Exactly what I myself had thought, many times.
Exactly what was perfectly manifest to me at the moment.
Till you’re a gentleman, said Biddy.
You know I never shall be, so that’s always.
I wish I could! said Biddy.
Don’t mind me.
But you never will, you see, said Biddy.
I therefore observed I was not quite sure of that.
But Biddy said she _was_, and she said it decisively.
Nor I neither, said Biddy.
Though _that_ makes no difference to you.
Wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud.
Of that group I was one.
A highly popular murder had been committed, and Mr.
Wopsle was imbrued in blood to the eyebrows.
The coroner, in Mr.
Wopsle’s hands, became Timon of Athens; the beadle, Coriolanus.
Well! said the stranger to Mr.
He looked at everybody coldly and sarcastically.
Guilty, of course? said he.
Out with it.
Come! Sir, returned Mr.
I told you so.
But now I’ll ask you a question.
Don’t evade the question.
Either you know it, or you don’t know it.
Wopsle,—as it were to mark him out—before biting it again.
Now! said he.
Certainly you know it.
Throwing his finger at him again.
Attend to me.
Yes, or no? Mr.
Come! said the stranger, I’ll help you.
You don’t deserve help, but I’ll help you.
Look at that paper you hold in your hand.
What is it? What is it? repeated Mr.
Wopsle, eyeing it, much at a loss.
Turn to the paper.
(We all began to think Mr.
Wopsle answered, Those are not the exact words.
Not the exact words! repeated the gentleman bitterly.
Is that the exact substance? Yes, said Mr.
Which is the man? Here is the man, said Joe.
It will take a little time.
Perhaps we had better go to your place of residence.
I am pretty well known.
It was not asked, and you see me here.
No less, no more.
I thought Mr.
Very well, said Mr.
Who’s a-going to try? retorted Joe.
I don’t say anybody is.
Bear that in mind, will you? repeated Mr.
Now, I return to this young fellow.
Joe and I gasped, and looked at one another.
I am instructed to communicate to him, said Mr.
It may be years hence.
This is not for you to inquire into.
The condition is laid down.
I should think not! Now, Mr.
Pip, I have done with stipulations.
Though he called me Mr.
We come next, to mere details of arrangement.
You will please consider me your guardian.
I said I had always longed for it.
Never mind what you have always longed for, Mr.
Pip, he retorted; keep to the record.
If you long for it now, that’s enough.
Now, your inclinations are to be consulted.
I don’t think that wise, mind, but it’s my trust.
Wopsle’s great-aunt; so, I replied in the negative.
I don’t recommend him, observe; because I never recommend anybody.
The gentleman I speak of is one Mr.
Ah! I caught at the name directly.
Miss Havisham’s relation.
The Matthew whom Mr.
Camilla had spoken of.
You know the name? said Mr.
My answer was, that I had heard of the name.
Oh! said he.
You have heard of the name.
Recommendation is not the word, Mr.
Matthew Pocket— _That_’s more like it! cried Mr.
Jaggers.—And (I added), I would gladly try that gentleman.
You had better try him in his own house.
First, said Mr.
Say this day week.
You’ll want some money.
And it are understood.
And it ever will be similar according.
But what, said Mr.
For the loss of his services.
No half measures with me.
They were these.
I am paid for undertaking it, and I do so.
Now, understand that, finally.
I beg your pardon, Mr.
I would rather you told, Joe.
Joe held his knees and looked at me.
I looked at both of them.
To the best of my belief, those efforts entirely failed.
Though Heaven knows they never did by word or sign.
They’ll soon go.
Soon, soon go, said Biddy.
So might Wopsle.
And the Jolly Bargemen might take it as a compliment.
That’s just what I don’t want, Joe.
Ah, that indeed, Pip! said Joe.
Biddy said no more.
And Joe, I am very glad you did so.
Have you though? said Joe.
I’m so awful dull.
I’m only master of my own trade.
For instance, Biddy, in his learning and his manners.
And don’t you think he knows that? asked Biddy.
Not all of one kind, resumed Biddy.
I did not expect to see this in you.
You are envious, Biddy, and grudging.
But after this I ask you nothing.
It’s a—it’s a bad side of human nature.
Well! said Mr.
Trabb, in a hail-fellow-well-met kind of way.
A change passed over Mr.
My dear sir, said Mr.
Hold that noise, said Mr.
Now, this, said Mr.
But you shall see some others.
Trabb’s judgment, and re-entered the parlour to be measured.
For although Mr.
He was waiting for me with great impatience.
My dear friend, said Mr.
To think, said Mr.
I begged Mr.
My dear young friend, said Mr.
Pumblechook, in the way of a compassionate adjuration.
But my dear young friend, said Mr.
Pumblechook, you must be hungry, you must be exhausted.
But do I, said Mr.
Here is wine, said Mr.
Ah! poultry, poultry! You little thought, said Mr.
We’ll drink her health, said I.
Ah! cried Mr.
Let us never be blind, said Mr.
I mentioned to Mr.
Those were the two little words, more capital.
We drank all the wine, and Mr.
There, I was roused by Mr.
Pumblechook’s hailing me.
I stopped, and he came up breathless.
Not if I can help it.
My clothes were rather a disappointment, of course.
Pumblechook was not at home.
You? said she.
She was then just abreast of the rotted bride-cake.
Don’t go, Sarah, she said.
I have seen Mr.
_I_ have heard about it, Pip.
So you go to-morrow? Yes, Miss Havisham.
Not named? No, Miss Havisham.
Jaggers is made your guardian? Yes, Miss Havisham.
Be good—deserve it—and abide by Mr.
Yes, Miss Havisham.
I did not.
It was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it.
Then I took up my little portmanteau and walked out.
I whistled and made nothing of going.
How much? I asked the coachman.
Then it must be a shilling, observed the coachman.
I don’t want to get into trouble.
_I_ know _him_! He darkly closed an eye at Mr.
Jaggers’s name, and shook his head.
Jaggers at home? He is not, returned the clerk.
He is in Court at present.
Am I addressing Mr.
Pip? I signified that he was addressing Mr.
Jaggers left word, would you wait in his room.
Go and wait outside, Mike, said the clerk.
Jaggers’s chair, being greasy with shoulders.
I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr.
But I sat wondering and waiting in Mr.
Jaggers’s chair, and got up and went out.
I dropped into the office to ask if Mr.
Jaggers, as well as I.
Jaggers coming across the road towards me.
First, he took the two secret men.
Now, I have nothing to say to _you_, said Mr.
Jaggers, throwing his finger at them.
I want to know no more than I know.
As to the result, it’s a toss-up.
I told you from the first it was a toss-up.
Very well; then you may go.
We thought, Mr.
Jaggers— one of the men began, pulling off his hat.
That’s what I told you not to do, said Mr.
_You_ thought! I think for you; that’s enough for you.
Now I won’t have it.
I won’t hear a word.
The two men looked at one another as Mr.
And now _you_! said Mr.
And do you remember, retorted Mr.
Now, I tell you what! said Mr.
Once for all.
Have you paid Wemmick? O yes, sir! Every farden.
Then you have done all you have got to do.
Jaggers’s coat to his lips several times.
I don’t know this man! said Mr.
Hown brother to Habraham Latharuth? Who’s he? said Mr.
Let go of my coat.
You’re too late, said Mr.
I am over the way.
Jaggers, and there’s an end of it.
Get out of the way.
Oh! said Mr.
Jaggers suddenly became most irate.
Now, be careful.
A sort of a pastry-cook.
Is he here? asked my guardian.
Take him past that window, and let me see him.
The window indicated was the office window.
I was to go to Barnard’s Inn, to young Mr.
You will find your credit good, Mr.
Casting my eyes on Mr.
So you were never in London before? said Mr.
Wemmick to me.
No, said I.
_I_ was new here once, said Mr.
I know the moves of it.
You may get cheated, robbed, and murdered in London.
O! I don’t know about bad blood, returned Mr.
Wemmick; there’s not much bad blood about.
That makes it worse.
You think so? returned Mr.
Much about the same, I should say.
Do you know where Mr.
Matthew Pocket lives? I asked Mr.
Yes, said he, nodding in the direction.
At Hammersmith, west of London.
Is that far? Well! Say five miles.
Wemmick, looking at me with an approving air.
Yes, I know him.
So it does me.
He hardly thought you’d come so soon, Mr.
As I keep the cash, Mr.
Wemmick observed, we shall most likely meet pretty often.
I put out my hand, and Mr.
I have got so out of it! said Mr.
Wemmick,—except at last.
Very glad, I’m sure, to make your acquaintance.
Pip? said he.
Pocket? said I.
Dear me! he exclaimed.
Dear me! said Mr.
Pray come in, said Mr.
Allow me to lead the way.
Pray let me take these bags from you.
I am quite ashamed.
As I stood opposite to Mr.
The idea of its being you! said he.
The idea of its being _you_! said I.
And then we contemplated one another afresh, and laughed again.
I derived from this speech that Mr.
No, said I.
No, he acquiesced: I heard it had happened very lately.
_I_ was rather on the lookout for good fortune then.
But she couldn’t,—at all events, she didn’t.
Bad taste, said Herbert, laughing, but a fact.
What’s that? I asked, with sudden gravity.
Affianced, he explained, still busy with the fruit.
Any word of that sort.
How did you bear your disappointment? I asked.
Pooh! said he, I didn’t care much for it.
_She’s_ a Tartar.
What relation is she to Miss Havisham? None, said he.
Pip! said he.
Don’t you know? No, said I.
Jaggers is your guardian, I understand? he went on.
I don’t know how this was.
I tell you what I should like.
I should like it very much.
True, he replied.
I’ll redeem it at once.
Also, the spoon is not generally used over-hand, but under.
This has two advantages.
Now, he pursued, concerning Miss Havisham.
Miss Havisham, you must know, was a spoilt child.
You see it every day.
Havisham was very rich and very proud.
So was his daughter.
Miss Havisham was an only child? I hazarded.
Stop a moment, I am coming to that.
Her father privately married again—his cook, I rather think.
I thought he was proud, said I.
My good Handel, so he was.
I thanked him, and apologised.
He said, Not at all, and resumed.
There is no doubt that she perfectly idolized him.
The day came, but not the bridegroom.
Is that all the story? I asked, after considering it.
But I have forgotten one thing.
Mind! I don’t know that.
Are they alive now? I don’t know.
When adopted? Herbert shrugged his shoulders.
I know no more.
All that I know about Miss Havisham, you know.
And all that I know, I retorted, you know.
I fully believe it.
I shall also do a little in the mining way.
It’s an interesting trade.
And the profits are large? said I.
Tremendous! said he.
Also to Ceylon, especially for elephants’ tusks.
You will want a good many ships, said I.
A perfect fleet, said he.
I am looking about me.
Somehow, that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnard’s Inn.
I said (in a tone of conviction), Ah-h! Yes.
I am in a counting-house, and looking about me.
Is a counting-house profitable? I asked.
Yes; to you.
Why, n-no; not to me.
Not directly profitable.
_That’s_ the grand thing.
Pocket’s children were playing about.
Mamma, said Herbert, this is young Mr.
Upon which Mrs.
Pocket received me with an appearance of amiable dignity.
Make haste up, Millers.
We were waiting, I supposed, for Mr.
Pocket, when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs.
Gracious me, Flopson! said Mrs.
Why, if it ain’t your footstool! cried Flopson.
This had lasted but a very short time, when Mrs.
Be that as it may, he had directed Mrs.
Pocket that his wife was a treasure for a Prince.
They allowed a very liberal table to Mr.
This greatly distressed Mrs.
By degrees I learnt, and chiefly from Herbert, that Mr.
This lady’s name was Mrs.
Pocket that dear Mr.
But dear Mrs.
Pocket, said Mrs.
Coiler, after her early disappointment (not that dear Mr.
—That it _is_ hard, said Mrs.
Coiler, to have dear Mr.
Pocket’s time and attention diverted from dear Mrs.
It came to my knowledge, through what passed between Mrs.
It further appeared that the book I had seen Mrs.
Pocket as a woman and a sister.
No one but themselves and Mrs.
Coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me.
After dinner the children were introduced, and Mrs.
Thus advised, Mrs.
Then, all the children laughed, and Mr.
I was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs.
How dare you tell me so? retorted Mrs.
Go and sit down in your chair this moment! Mrs.
Belinda, remonstrated Mr.
I will not allow anybody to interfere, said Mrs.
Good God! cried Mr.
Pocket, in an outbreak of desolate desperation.
Pocket, with a majestic glance at that innocent little offender.
I hope I know my poor grandpapa’s position.
Jane, indeed! Mr.
Hear this! he helplessly exclaimed to the elements.
Drummle, said Mrs.
It doubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs.
Pocket, which were exemplified in the following manner.
In the evening there was rowing on the river.
Speak to your master? said Mrs.
Pocket, whose dignity was roused again.
Or speak to me—at some other time.
This is a pretty thing, Belinda! said Mr.
Pocket, returning with a countenance expressive of grief and despair.
Sophia has told you, said Mrs.
Pocket, for making mischief? Mr.
Pocket uttered a dismal groan.
There was a sofa where Mr.
Pocket and I had a long talk together.
I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing to the contrary.
Go it! said Mr.
Jaggers, with a short laugh.
I told you you’d get on.
Come! retorted Mr.
How much? Fifty pounds? O, not nearly so much.
Five pounds? said Mr.
More than that, eh! retorted Mr.
Come! said Mr.
Let’s get at it.
Four times five will do handsomely, will it? said Mr.
Jaggers, knitting his brows.
Never mind what _I_ make it, my friend, observed Mr.
Jaggers, with a knowing and contradictory toss of his head.
I want to know what _you_ make it.
Twenty pounds, of course.
Wemmick! said Mr.
Jaggers, opening his office door.
Pip’s written order, and pay him twenty pounds.
There are only four of us.
I accepted the offer.
Getting evidence together, said Mr.
Wemmick, as we came out, for the Bailey.
Jaggers’s own use.
This was all the establishment.
These are two celebrated ones.
Like him? It’s himself, you know.
No, returned Wemmick.
Only his game.
He has the same look.
You’re right, said Wemmick; it’s the genuine look.
You were a gentlemanly Cove, though (Mr.
One brings another, you see; that’s the way of it.
I always take ’em.
And they’re property.
I said I should be delighted to accept his hospitality.
Have you dined with Mr.
Jaggers yet? Not yet.
Well, said Wemmick, he’ll give you wine, and good wine.
I’ll give you punch, and not bad punch.
And now I’ll tell you something.
When you go to dine with Mr.
Jaggers, look at his housekeeper.
Not so very uncommon, you’ll tell me.
It won’t lower your opinion of Mr.
Keep your eye on it.
Thus, Bentley Drummle had come to Mr.
Herbert was my intimate companion and friend.
When I had been in Mr.
Pocket’s family a month or two, Mr.
Camilla turned up.
Camilla was Mr.
I had not seen Mr.
Did you think of walking down to Walworth? said he.
Certainly, said I, if you approve.
I let him, of course.
As far as it goes, it’s property and portable.
I then said what politeness required.
So, you haven’t dined with Mr.
Jaggers yet? he pursued, as we walked along.
I expect you’ll have an invitation to-morrow.
He’s going to ask your pals, too.
Don’t look forward to variety, but you’ll have excellence.
Is he never robbed? That’s it! returned Wemmick.
They dread him so much? said I.
Dread him, said Wemmick.
I believe you they dread him.
No silver, sir.
Britannia metal, every spoon.
He’d have all he could get.
A river’s its natural depth, and he’s his natural depth.
Look at his watch-chain.
That’s real enough.
It’s very massive, said I.
Massive? repeated Wemmick.
I think so.
My own doing, said Wemmick.
Then look here.
Well; it’s a good thing, you know.
It brushes the Newgate cobwebs away, and pleases the Aged.
Nod away at him, Mr.
Pip; that’s what he likes.
This is a pretty pleasure-ground, sir.
Is it your own, Mr.
Jaggers admires it? Never seen it, said Wemmick.
Never heard of it.
Never seen the Aged.
Never heard of him.
I don’t wish it professionally spoken about.
Who’s the Spider? The spider? said I.
The blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow.
No other attendant than the housekeeper appeared.
If you talk of strength, said Mr.
Jaggers, _I_’ll show you a wrist.
Molly, let them see your wrist.
_I_’ll show you a wrist, repeated Mr.
Jaggers, with an immovable determination to show it.
Molly, let them see your wrist.
Master, she again murmured.
Please! Molly, said Mr.
There’s power here, said Mr.
Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinews with his forefinger.
The moment he ceased, she looked at him again.
That’ll do, Molly, said Mr.
At half-past nine, gentlemen, said he, we must break up.
Pray make the best use of your time.
I am glad to see you all.
Drummle, I drink to you.
Through all his stages, Mr.
Jaggers followed him with the same strange interest.
He actually seemed to serve as a zest to Mr.
Well, retorted Drummle; he’ll be paid.
_You_ should think! retorted Drummle.
You are right, said Drummle.
I wouldn’t lend one of you a sixpence.
I wouldn’t lend anybody a sixpence.
Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say.
_You_ should say, repeated Drummle.
Gentlemen, said Mr.
On this hint we all rose to depart.
I like that Spider though.
Keep as clear of him as you can.
You know what I am, don’t you? Good night, Pip.
Good night, sir.
Pocket, he went home to the family hole.
No more, dear Mr.
Pip, from Your ever obliged, and affectionate servant, BIDDY.
He wishes me most particular to write _what larks_.
He says you will understand.
I am glad to see you, Joe.
Give me your hat.
And you, Joe, look wonderfully well.
Thank God, said Joe, I’m ekerval to most.
And your sister, she’s no worse than she were.
And Biddy, she’s ever right and ready.
And all friends is no backerder, if not no forarder.
’Ceptin Wopsle; he’s had a drop.
Were you at his performance, Joe? I inquired.
I _were_, said Joe, with emphasis and solemnity.
Partickler when he see the ghost.
Do you take tea, or coffee, Mr.
Gargery? asked Herbert, who always presided of a morning.
When did you come to town, Mr.
No it were not.
Yes it were.
Us two being now alone, sir,—began Joe.
Well, sir, pursued Joe, this is how it were.
It was you, Joe.
Yes, Joe? Go on, please.
Her expression air then as follering: ‘Mr.
You air in correspondence with Mr.
If there’s been any fault at all to-day, it’s mine.
I’m wrong in these clothes.
He touched me gently on the forehead, and went out.
Surely a curious thing.
My patroness, too, might hear of him, and not approve.
On the whole, I resolved to leave the Avenger behind.
You don’t mind them, Handel? said Herbert.
But I don’t mind them.
They wore the dress that I likewise knew well.
But this was not the worst of it.
I’ll put ’em on the outside of the row.
They won’t interfere with you, sir.
You needn’t know they’re there.
And don’t blame _me_, growled the convict I had recognised.
_I_ don’t want to go.
_I_ am quite ready to stay behind.
Or mine, said the other, gruffly.
Good-bye, Handel! Herbert called out as we started.
How should I know? returned the other.
He had ’em stowed away somehows.
Giv him by friends, I expect.
Two one pound notes, or friends? Two one pound notes.
And I did.
More fool you, growled the other.
He must have been a green one.
Different gangs and different ships.
Mudbank, mist, swamp, and work; work, swamp, mist, and mudbank.
This device I executed successfully.
Pumblechook? No, said I, certainly not.
Betimes in the morning I was up and out.
Orlick! Ah, young master, there’s more changes than yours.
But come in, come in.
It’s opposed to my orders to hold the gate open.
I had my box brought alongside me in a barrow.
Then you have left the forge? I said.
However, I come here some time since you left.
I could have told you that, Orlick.
Ah! said he, dryly.
But then you’ve got to be a scholar.
It’s easier than bellowsing and hammering.—That’s loaded, that is.
Oh! said she.
You, is it, Mr.
Pip? It is, Miss Pocket.
I am glad to tell you that Mr.
Pocket and family are all well.
Pip’s rap, I heard her say, immediately; come in, Pip.
Is _he_ changed? Miss Havisham asked her.
Very much, said Estella, looking at me.
You rewarded me very much.
Did I? she replied, in an incidental and forgetful way.
He and I are great friends now.
Naturally, said I.
Not the least.
Not remember that you made me cry? said I.
That I knew better.
That there could be no such beauty without it.
But you know what I mean.
I have no softness there, no—sympathy—sentiment—nonsense.
And yet I could not trace this to Miss Havisham.
No! imperiously stopping me as I opened my lips.
I have not bestowed my tenderness anywhere.
I have never had any such thing.
Instantly the ghost passed once more and was gone.
What _was_ it? What is the matter? asked Estella.
Then you don’t? Very well.
It is said, at any rate.
Her handsome dress had trailed upon the ground.
If she wounds you, love her.
Hear me, Pip! I adopted her, to be loved.
I bred her and educated her, to be loved.
All this passed in a few seconds.
As punctual as ever, he repeated, coming up to us.
I considered, and said, Never.
And never will, Pip, he retorted, with a frowning smile.
Put your question.
Is it Havisham or—? I had nothing to add.
Or what? said he.
Is it Havisham? It is Havisham.
Anything to equal the determined reticence of Mr.
He was coming round a narrow corner.
This time, he was entirely changed.
I wrote, however, to Mr.
Trabb by next day’s post, to say that Mr.
The coach, with Mr.
It concerns myself, Herbert, said I, and one other person.
Of course I know _that_.
How do you know it? said I.
How do I know it, Handel? Why, from you.
I never told you.
You brought your adoration and your portmanteau here together.
And I saw her yesterday.
Patience, my dear Handel: time enough, time enough.
You call me a lucky fellow.
Of course, I am.
You say I am lucky.
Didn’t you tell me that your guardian, Mr.
Jaggers would not be in it.
You won’t succeed, said I.
O yes I shall! said he.
One, two, three, and now I am in for it.
There was silence between us for a little while.
Think of her bringing-up, and think of Miss Havisham.
This may lead to miserable things.
You can’t detach yourself? No.
Impossible! You can’t try, Handel? No.
Because it is decidedly the case with us.
Little Jane is the same.
Then you are? said I.
I am, said Herbert; but it’s a secret.
May I ask the name? I said.
Name of Clara, said Herbert.
Her father had to do with the victualling of passenger-ships.
I think he was a species of purser.
What is he now? said I.
He’s an invalid now, replied Herbert.
Living on—? On the first floor, said Herbert.
But I have heard him constantly.
Don’t you expect to see him? said I.
But I don’t know how long the rafters may hold.
Wopsle and Denmark.
Several curious little circumstances transpired as the action proceeded.
This occasioned its terrors to be received derisively.
Wopsle on every one of these occasions.
The joy attended Mr.
Wopsle; but they were too hopeless to be persisted in.
Pip and friend? Identity of Mr.
Pip and friend confessed.
Waldengarver? I repeated—when Herbert murmured in my ear, Probably Wopsle.
Oh! said I.
Shall we follow you? A few steps, please.
But I said he had looked very nice.
Gentlemen, said Mr.
Wopsle, I am proud to see you.
I hope, Mr.
Pip, you will excuse my sending round.
Skin the stockings off Mr.
Bust ’em, and you’ll bust five-and-thirty shillings.
Shakspeare never was complimented with a finer pair.
But then, Mr.
So I said Capitally.
Waldengarver, almost, if not quite, with patronage.
Herbert said from behind (again poking me), Massive and concrete.
I am glad to have your approbation, gentlemen, said Mr.
But I’ll tell you one thing, Mr.
Did you observe, gentlemen, said Mr.
I added, He was drunk, no doubt.
O dear no, sir, said Mr.
Wopsle, not drunk.
His employer would see to that, sir.
His employer would not allow him to be drunk.
You know his employer? said I.
That is his employer, gentlemen.
It had no set beginning, as Dear Mr.
She sends you her regard.
Both flourishing thankye, said Wemmick, and particularly the Aged.
He’s in wonderful feather.
He’ll be eighty-two next birthday.
However, this is not London talk.
Did your client commit the robbery? I asked.
Bless your soul and body, no, answered Wemmick, very drily.
But he is accused of it.
So might you or I be.
Either of us might be accused of it, you know.
Only neither of us is, I remarked.
I then rejoined Mr.
Jaggers’s business; though something of the state of Mr.
Jaggers hung about him too, forbidding approach beyond certain limits.
I’m only a subordinate.
I can’t take it.
Don’t go on in that way with a subordinate.
Don’t try on useless measures.
Yes, it was too strong, sir,—but _I_ don’t care.
No, no, said Wemmick, coolly, _you_ don’t care.
Then, turning to me, Served His Majesty this man.
Was a soldier in the line and bought his discharge.
Perhaps, returned my friend, but there’s no knowing.
Thankye, said Wemmick, shaking hands with him.
Same to you, Colonel.
I’ll accept the will for the deed, said Wemmick.
By the by; you were quite a pigeon-fancier.
The man looked up at the sky.
I am told you had a remarkable breed of tumblers.
All right, said Wemmick, they shall be taken care of.
O yes, I dare say! said the turnkey.
Now, that’s the way with them here, Mr.
Pip, remarked Wemmick, turning to me with his post-office elongated.
Mind you, Mr.
He’s always so high.
I am going to Richmond, she told me.
The distance is ten miles.
She said them slightingly, but not with displeasure.
A carriage will have to be sent for, Estella.
How do you thrive with Mr.
At least? repeated Estella.
As pleasantly as I could anywhere, away from you.
No, no you may be sure of that, said Estella.
You may be certain that I laugh because they fail.
It is not easy for even you.
Two things I can tell you, said Estella.
I must think a moment.
A spirit of contempt for the fawners and plotters.
But, yes, if you like.
Why repeat it a thousand times? So it always was.
What place is that? Estella asked me.
It is a curious place.
When we passed through Hammersmith, I showed her where Mr.
But happening to look up at Mrs.
My conscience was not by any means comfortable about Biddy.
In the meantime Mr.
And I know Herbert thought so too.
Look the thing in the face.
Look into your affairs.
Stare them out of countenance.
Really your business powers are very remarkable.
I thought so too.
had put in a funereal execution and taken possession.
I then descried Mr.
Pocket-handkerchiefs out, all! cried Mr.
Trabb at this point, in a depressed business-like voice.
Finally, he went away with Mr.
Do you, Mr.
Pip? said Biddy.
I should have written if I had thought that.
Do you, Mr.
I have been speaking to Mrs.
Hubble, and I am going to her to-morrow.
Gargery, together, until he settles down.
I’ll tell you, Mr.
You know, Mr.
I think you would always improve, Biddy, under any circumstances.
Well! I thought I would give up that point too.
They are very slight, poor thing.
Gargery from the forge.
Nothing was ever discovered, Biddy? Nothing.
I am not going to leave poor Joe alone.
Biddy said never a single word.
Biddy, don’t you hear me? Yes, Mr.
Not to mention your calling me Mr.
Now, don’t echo, I retorted.
You used not to echo, Biddy.
Used not! said Biddy.
Have the goodness, Biddy, to tell me why.
This shocks me very much.
Early in the morning I was to go.
Once more, the mists were rising as I walked away.
Herbert himself had come of age eight months before me.
Well, Pip, said he, I must call you Mr.
Take a chair, Mr.
Pip, said my guardian.
If you please, sir.
What do you suppose, said Mr.
Reluctantly, I confessed myself quite unable to answer the question.
This reply seemed agreeable to Mr.
Ask one, said Mr.
Jaggers, and ask another.
Wemmick appeared, handed it in, and disappeared.
Pip, said Mr.
Jaggers, attend, if you please.
You know you must say yes; don’t you? said Mr.
Yes, yes, my friend, cried Mr.
You’ll excuse me, but I know better than you.
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
You have got it? Very good.
Now, unfold it and tell me what it is.
This is a bank-note, said I, for five hundred pounds.
That is a bank-note, repeated Mr.
Jaggers, for five hundred pounds.
And a very handsome sum of money too, I think.
You consider it, undoubtedly, a handsome sum of money.
Now, that handsome sum of money, Pip, is your own.
Jaggers stopped me.
Jaggers, which you desired me to waive for a moment.
Jaggers, will soon— there I delicately stopped.
Will soon what? asked Mr.
That’s no question as it stands, you know.
Just so, said Mr.
Jaggers, that’s my answer.
Do you suppose it will still be years hence, Mr.
Come! said Mr.
That’s a question I must not be asked.
When that person discloses, said Mr.
And that’s all I have got to say.
Wemmick, said I, I want to ask your opinion.
I am very desirous to serve a friend.
Now I want somehow to help him to a beginning.
There’s as many as six, you see, to choose from.
I don’t understand you, said I.
Choose your bridge, Mr.
This is very discouraging, said I.
Meant to be so, said Wemmick.
Certainly he should not.
And that, said I, is your deliberate opinion, Mr.
Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr.
Jaggers is another.
They must not be confounded together.
Jaggers and I turned ours.
Deeming Sunday the best day for taking Mr.
He is very regular in his walks, is my son.
Very regular in everything, is my son.
Yes; so they tell me.
His business is the Law? I nodded harder.
Jaggers, I roared that name at him.
No, said the old gentleman; the warehousing, the warehousing.
Pip, I must tell you one thing.
This is devilish good of you.
Say you’ll help me to be good then, said I.
Ecod, replied Wemmick, shaking his head, that’s not my trade.
Nor is this your trading-place, said I.
You are right, he returned.
You hit the nail on the head.
Skiffins (that’s her brother) is an accountant and agent.
I’ll look him up and go to work for you.
I thank you ten thousand times.
We are all attention, Aged One.
The Aged’s reading reminded me of the classes at Mr.
Shortly afterwards, his mouth began to widen again.
At last, the Aged read himself into a light slumber.
Miss Skiffins’s brother conducted the negotiation.
Wemmick pervaded it throughout, but never appeared in it.
The lady with whom Estella was placed, Mrs.
Brandley’s house and out of Mrs.
She had admirers without end.
You are to pay all charges out of my purse.
You stock and stone! exclaimed Miss Havisham.
You should know, said Estella.
I am what you have made me.
What would you have? Love, replied the other.
You have it.
I have not, said Miss Havisham.
All I possess is freely yours.
Beyond that, I have nothing.
Who taught me to be proud? returned Estella.
Who taught me to be hard? returned Estella.
I have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes.
I have never been unfaithful to you or your schooling.
I lay in that separate building across the courtyard.
A thousand Miss Havishams haunted me.
Never you mind, retorted Drummle.
Estella of where? said I.
You are bound to say of where.
Which he was, as a Finch.
_Do_ you? said Drummle.
And so do I, I added, with a scarlet face.
_Do_ you? said Drummle.
The Spider, as Mr.
Are you tired, Estella? Rather, Pip.
You should be.
Recounting to-night’s triumph? said I.
Surely a very poor one, Estella.
For he has been hovering about you all night.
Anything you like.
But, Estella, do hear me speak.
You know he is despised.
Well? said she.
You know he is as ungainly within as without.
A deficient, ill-tempered, lowering, stupid fellow.
Well? said she.
It’s not worth discussing.
Oh! don’t be so proud, Estella, and so inflexible.
Here is Mrs.
I’ll say no more.
I was three-and-twenty years of age.
Our chambers were in Garden-court, down by the river.
Business had taken Herbert on a journey to Marseilles.
Yes, said a voice from the darkness beneath.
What floor do you want? The top.
And the man came on.
That he had long iron-grey hair.
That his age was about sixty.
Pray what is your business? I asked him.
My business? he repeated, pausing.
I will explain my business, by your leave.
But, I saw nothing that in the least explained him.
I’ll speak in half a minute.
Give me half a minute, please.
You’d be sorry arterwards to have done it.
You acted noble, my boy, said he.
Stay! said I.
I am glad to tell you so.
But our ways are different ways, none the less.
You are wet, and you look weary.
There was a tray ready on a side-table.
How are you living? I asked him.
I hope you have done well? I’ve done wonderfully well.
I’m famous for it.
I am glad to hear it.
I hope to hear you say so, my dear boy.
I warn’t likely to it.
You can put them to some other poor boy’s use.
I took out my purse.
It was only now that I began to tremble.
Might a mere warmint ask what property? said he.
I faltered, I don’t know.
Might a mere warmint ask whose property? said he.
I faltered again, I don’t know.
Concerning a guardian, he went on.
Some lawyer, maybe.
As to the first letter of that lawyer’s name now.
‘However, you have found me out,’ you says just now.
That person’s name? Why, Wemmick.
Look’ee here, Pip.
I’m your second father.
You’re my son,—more to me nor any son.
I’ve put away money, only for you to spend.
It was the one grain of relief I had.
Was there no one else? I asked.
He laid his hand on my shoulder.
At last I done it.
Where will you put me? he asked, presently.
I must be put somewheres, dear boy.
To sleep? said I.
It’s death to come back.
My uncle, I muttered.
You saw him, sir? Yes.
Likewise the person with him? Person with him! I repeated.
I had not the power to attend to it.
By and by, his door opened and he came out.
I have given out that you are my uncle.
That’s it, dear boy! Call me uncle.
I took the name of Provis.
Magwitch, he answered, in the same tone; chrisen’d Abel.
I was in the provinces mostly.
The last time.
First knowed Mr.
Jaggers that way.
Jaggers was for me.
Similarly, I must have my smoke.
There’s something worth spending in that there book, dear boy.
All I’ve got ain’t mine; it’s yourn.
Don’t you be afeerd on it.
There’s more where that come from.
That’ll be _my_ pleasure.
_My_ pleasure ’ull be fur to see him do it.
I want to know what is to be done.
I forgot myself half a minute ago.
What I said was low; that’s what it was; low.
Look’ee here, Pip.
Look over it.
I ain’t a-going to be low.
Lowness goes first.
Look’ee here, Pip.
I was low; that’s what I was; low.
Look over it, dear boy.
Now, go on, dear boy.
There’s Jaggers, and there’s Wemmick, and there’s you.
Well, he returned, there ain’t many.
I’m not a-going back.
I’ve come for good.
Where are you to live? said I.
What then, when that’s once done? Here I am.
But it was by no means so plain to Mr.
Now, Pip, said he, be careful.
I will, sir, I returned.
Don’t commit yourself, said Mr.
Jaggers, and don’t commit any one.
You understand—any one.
I merely want, Mr.
Told would seem to imply verbal communication.
I will say, informed, Mr.
That is the man, said Mr.
Jaggers, in New South Wales.
And only he? said I.
And only he, said Mr.
As you say, Pip, returned Mr.
Not a particle of evidence, Pip, said Mr.
Jaggers, shaking his head and gathering up his skirts.
Take nothing on its looks; take everything on evidence.
There’s no better rule.
I have verified my information, and there’s an end.
You are quite aware of that? Quite, sir.
I also communicated to him another caution.
I gave Magwitch that caution, said Mr.
He guided himself by it, no doubt.
No doubt, said I.
I have been informed by Wemmick, pursued Mr.
Or Provis—thank you, Pip.
You know it’s Provis.
Good day, Pip, said Mr.
Jaggers, offering his hand; glad to have seen you.
It lasted about five days.
This is—a visitor of mine.
Take it in your right hand.
But don’t you fret yourself on that score.
We interchanged that confidence without shaping a syllable.
So was I, Herbert, when the blow first fell.
Still, something must be done.
He must be stopped somehow.
Well, well, well! Herbert remonstrated.
Don’t say fit for nothing.
Anyhow, my dear Handel, said he presently, soldiering won’t do.
I am working up towards a partnership, you know.
Poor fellow! He little suspected with whose money.
But there is another question, said Herbert.
I know he is, I returned.
I know nothing of his life.
There is but one way that I know of.
I must ask him point blank.
With this project formed, we went to bed.
Waking, I never lost that fear.
You remember? Remember! said he.
As to anything I say, you know, he insisted.
The oath applies to all.
I understand it to do so.
So be it.
Dear boy and Pip’s comrade.
There, you’ve got it.
I’ve been done everything to, pretty well—except hanged.
I’ve been locked up as much as a silver tea-kittle.
I know’d my name to be Magwitch, chrisen’d Abel.
They always went on agen me about the Devil.
He was good-looking too.
There’s room.’ ‘What can you do?’ says Compeyson.
But Arthur soon settled the account.
‘Why look at her!’ he cries out.
‘Yes,’ says Compeyson’s wife.
She’s unfolding it.
She’s coming out of the corner.
She’s coming to the bed.
Hah! she missed me that time.
Don’t let her throw it over my shoulders.
She’s lifting me up.
Well! he said, I _was_, and got convicted.
I hunted him down.
I smashed his face.
Is he dead? I asked, after a silence.
Is who dead, dear boy? Compeyson.
I never heerd no more of him.
On my presenting myself at Mrs.
Where? To Satis House, as usual.
Is this a cut? said Mr.
Drummle, my shoulders squared and my back to the fire.
You have just come down? said Mr.
Drummle, edging me a little away with his shoulder.
Beastly place, said Drummle.
Your part of the country, I think? Yes, I assented.
I am told it’s very like your Shropshire.
Not in the least like it, said Drummle.
Drummle looked at my boots, and I looked at his.
Do you stay here long? Can’t say, answered Mr.
Do you? Can’t say, said I.
Drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box.
He whistled a little.
So did I.
Large tract of marshes about here, I believe? said Drummle.
What of that? said I.
Are you amused, Mr.
Drummle? No, said he, not particularly.
I am going out for a ride in the saddle.
I mean to explore those marshes for amusement.
Out-of-the-way villages there, they tell me.
Curious little public-houses—and smithies—and that.
Waiter! Yes, sir.
Look here, you sir.
The lady won’t ride to-day; the weather won’t do.
Very good, sir.
Very good, sir.
Have you been to the Grove since? said Drummle.
Come, come! They let you off easily enough, sneered Drummle.
You shouldn’t have lost your temper.
I do, said Drummle.
But don’t lose your temper.
The waiter reappeared.
Look here, you sir.
Estella was knitting, and Miss Havisham was looking on.
I derived that, from the look they interchanged.
It will not surprise you, it will not displease you.
Miss Havisham continued to look steadily at me.
I have found out who my patron is.
It is not my secret, but another’s.
And that Mr.
Well, well, well! she said.
What follows has another (and I hope more disinterested) purpose.
Why, they would have it so! So would you.
_I_ never made them.
They are your friends, said Miss Havisham.
All this time Estella knitted on.
You know that I have loved you long and dearly.
But I must say it now.
I know, said I, in answer to that action,—I know.
Still, I love you.
But I think she did not.
You address nothing in my breast, you touch nothing there.
I don’t care for what you say at all.
It is in _my_ nature, she returned.
I can do no more.
I shall do well enough, and so will my husband.
Say no more.
We shall never understand each other.
Come! Here is my hand.
This will pass in no time.
It was past midnight when I crossed London Bridge.
To help his memory I mentioned my name.
I was not quite sure, sir, but I thought so.
Here’s a note, sir.
The Castle battlements arose upon my view at eight o’clock.
Pip! said Wemmick.
That’s all right, said he, rubbing his hands.
Which gate did you come to? I told him.
I’m going to take a liberty with you.
Pip? he added, winking, as she disappeared.
Official sentiments are one thing.
We are extra official.
I cordially assented.
I understand you.
By whom? said I.
I don’t tell it you on information received.
I heard it.
I couldn’t undertake to say that, of my own knowledge.
Is he living? One other nod.
And him you found? said I, with great anxiety.
And him I found.
Pip, I’ll tell you something.
Don’t break cover too soon.
However, I did not trouble Wemmick with these particulars.
That is to say: _Firstly_.
Well, sir! Mr.
It brings in more confusion, and you want confusion.
And now, Mr.
Here’s the address.
But, after you have gone home, don’t go back here.
You are very welcome, I am sure, Mr.
You don’t know what may happen to him.
Don’t let anything happen to the portable property.
Time’s up, said Wemmick, and I must be off.
Well; and a little bit of _him_.
Good-bye, Aged Parent! in a cheery shout.
_That’s_ her father.
Don’t you smell rum? He is always at it.
At rum? said I.
His room must be like a chandler’s shop.
His name is Mr.
This is Mr.
Barley’s breakfast for to-morrow, served out to be cooked.
There is an unconscionable old shark for you! said Herbert.
As we passed Mr.
Here’s old Bill Barley, bless your eyes.
Ahoy! Bless you.
He replied, certainly not, and that the lodger was Mr.
He also explained that the utmost known of Mr.
Campbell there was, that he (Herbert) had Mr.
So, when we went into the parlour where Mrs.
Campbell, but kept it to myself.
Next day I set myself to get the boat.
Some weeks passed without bringing any change.
We waited for Wemmick, and he made no sign.
Still, no new cause for fear arose.
The theatre where Mr.
I was aware that Mr.
This led to Mr.
I saw that you saw me.
Saw you, Mr.
Pip! he returned.
Yes, of course I saw you.
Becoming alarmed, I entreated Mr.
Wopsle to explain his meaning.
Oh! He can’t be in sight, said Mr.
He went out before I went off.
I saw him go.
I mistrusted a design to entrap me into some admission.
I dare say you wonder at me, Mr.
Pip; indeed, I see you do.
I could hardly believe it myself, if you told me.
Indeed? said I.
Better than he thought,—except the last clause.
I remember all that.
Pip, one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight.
I saw him over your shoulder.
Steady! I thought.
I put such questions to Mr.
Was his face at all disfigured? No, he believed not.
It was Mr.
Jaggers’s hand, and he passed it through my arm.
Don’t you know? said Mr.
You are going to dine? said Mr.
Then, said Mr.
Jaggers, come and dine with me.
As I stood idle by Mr.
But it was not to be done.
He turned his eyes on Mr.
Did you send that note of Miss Havisham’s to Mr.
Pip, Wemmick? Mr.
Jaggers asked, soon after we began dinner.
Pip into the office.
Here it is.
He handed it to his principal instead of to me.
It’s a note of two lines, Pip, said Mr.
At once, I think.
Jaggers, he needn’t write an answer, you know.
Jaggers, but not at me.
So, Pip! Our friend the Spider, said Mr.
Jaggers, has played his cards.
He has won the pool.
It was as much as I could do to assent.
Jaggers? I didn’t say so, Pip.
I am putting a case.
Jaggers, either beats or cringes.
Ask Wemmick _his_ opinion.
So here’s to Mrs.
Bentley Drummle, said Mr.
What’s the matter? said Mr.
Her look was very intent.
Jaggers was sharp with her.
We took our leave early, and left together.
Even when we were groping among Mr.
Wouldn’t say it to anybody but yourself, he answered.
He said no.
Ah, I dare say I did.
Deuce take me, he added, suddenly, I know I did.
I find I am not quite unscrewed yet.
A wild beast tamed, you called her.
And what do _you_ call her? The same.
How did Mr.
Jaggers tame her, Wemmick? That’s his secret.
She has been with him many a long year.
I wish you would tell me her story.
I feel a particular interest in being acquainted with it.
But what I do know I’ll tell you.
We are in our private and personal capacities, of course.
But she was acquitted.
It was a case of jealousy.
There had been a violent struggle, perhaps a fight.
Jaggers principally rested his case.
You must accept all consequences of that hypothesis.
You have nothing more to say to me to-night? Nothing.
I got your letter and destroyed it.
Begin again, and let me look at something else.
Stay! Now tell me.
Nine hundred pounds.
They are the secrets I have mentioned.
Is it true? Too true.
I thank you for the question.
But there is nothing.
You are still on friendly terms with Mr.
I dined with him yesterday.
All this she did without looking at me.
My name is on the first leaf.
O! she cried, despairingly.
I should have loved her under any circumstances.
Is she married? Yes.
Yes, yes, I know it.
At first, I meant no more.
Well, well! said I.
I hope so.
Whose child was Estella? She shook her head.
You don’t know? She shook her head again.
Might I ask her age then? Two or three.
No matter with what other words we parted; we parted.
I took the latter course and went up.
I sat with Provis last night, Handel, two good hours.
Where was Clara? Dear little thing! said Herbert.
She was up and down with Gruffandgrim all the evening.
I doubt if he can hold out long, though.
I was speaking of Provis.
So you did.
And so he is.
His words had given me a start.
Your head is cool? he said, touching it.
Quite, said I.
Tell me what Provis said, my dear Herbert.
Perhaps I do, Herbert.
That is, he says she did.
He says it all.
I have no other information.
No, to be sure.
Look at me.
I do look at you, my dear boy.
I do touch you, my dear boy.
You are rather excited, but you are quite yourself.
I know I am quite myself.
Jaggers, and come at the bare truth.
There were periodical occasions when Mr.
Although I had sent Mr.
While I described the disaster, Mr.
Jaggers stood, according to his wont, before the fire.
Everybody should know his own business, said Mr.
And I saw Wemmick’s lips form the words portable property.
Jaggers:— I did ask something of Miss Havisham, however, sir.
Did she? said Mr.
But _she_ ought to know her own business best.
I know her mother.
Yes? said Mr.
And so have you, sir.
And you have seen her still more recently.
Yes? said Mr.
I know her father too.
A certain stop that Mr.
So! You know the young lady’s father, Pip? said Mr.
Jaggers started when I said those words.
And on what evidence, Pip, asked Mr.
For once, the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed.
My reply was so unexpected, that Mr.
I was very careful indeed as to that.
Hah! said Mr.
What item was it you were at, Wemmick, when Mr.
And seeing that Mr.
Jaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe.
What’s all this? said Mr.
I think you’re another.
_You_ with a pleasant home? said Mr.
But now about this other matter.
I’ll put a case to you.
Mind! I admit nothing.
Now, Pip, said Mr.
Jaggers, put this case.
I follow you, sir.
I follow you, sir.
I understand you perfectly.
And Wemmick repeated, No admissions.
Do you comprehend the imaginary case? Quite.
That the mother was still living.
That the father was still living.
Put that last case to yourself very carefully.
I ask Wemmick to put it to _him_self very carefully.
And Wemmick said, I do.
I looked at Wemmick, whose face was very grave.
He gravely touched his lips with his forefinger.
I did the same.
Jaggers did the same.
As he imparted this melancholy circumstance to Wemmick, Mr.
What are you about? demanded Wemmick, with the utmost indignation.
You did, said Wemmick.
Wemmick, pleaded Mike.
His what? demanded Wemmick, quite savagely.
Say that again! Now look here my man, said Mr.
Jaggers, advancing a step, and pointing to the door.
Get out of this office.
I’ll have no feelings here.
It serves you right, said Wemmick, Get out.
So, the unfortunate Mike very humbly withdrew, and Mr.
We had now got into the month of March.
My right arm was tolerably restored; disfigured, but fairly serviceable.
Burn this as soon as read.
I had thought of him more than once.
You go with him? No doubt.
_You must come alone_.
Bring this with you.
What to do now, I could not tell.
Still, the reference to Provis by name mastered everything.
Do you know the young man? said I.
Know him! repeated the landlord.
Ever since he was—no height at all.
And why? Because Pumblechook done everything for him.
Does Pumblechook say so? Say so! replied the landlord.
He han’t no call to say so.
Long-suffering and loving Joe, _you_ never complain.
Try a tenderer bit.
I can eat no more.
Please take it away.
Hard by was a small stone-quarry.
Still there was no answer, and I knocked again.
No answer still, and I tried the latch.
It rose under my hand, and the door yielded.
It was beginning to rain fast.
But, it was bound too tight for that.
Whom I had looked for, I don’t know.
I had not looked for him.
Let me go! Ah! he returned, _I_’ll let you go.
All in good time.
One keeps a secret better than two.
[Illustration] You cost me that place.
You gave it to yourself; you gained it for yourself.
You’re a liar.
Now, I’ll tell you a piece of information.
You goes out of his way this present night.
He’ll have no more on you.
It was you as did for your shrew sister.
It was you, villain, said I.
You was favoured, and he was bullied and beat.
You done it; now you pays for it.
He drank again, and became more ferocious.
Wolf, I’ll tell you something more.
I saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps.
Within this space, he now slouched backwards and forwards.
I had no grain of hope left.
Don’t be too eager.
The time has not gone by.
It is still Monday night.
But you can’t help groaning, my dear Handel.
I have no hurt but in this throbbing arm.
They laid it bare, and did what they could.
Wednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window.
It was then about high-water,—half-past eight.
Our plan was this.
There, we meant to lie by all night.
We knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel.
Is he there? said Herbert.
Faithful dear boy, well done.
I had seen none.
But we held our own without any appearance of molestation.
But you don’t know what it is.
I think I know the delights of freedom, I answered.
Ah, said he, shaking his head gravely.
But you don’t know it equal to me.
Well, he returned, drawing a long breath, I hope so.
Maybe I’m a growing a trifle old besides.
Do you, dear boy? and quietly sat down again.
We pushed off again, and made what way we could.
A four-oared galley, did you say? said I.
A four, said the Jack, and two sitters.
Why? _I_ know why, said the Jack.
_I_ knows what I thinks, observed the Jack.
_You_ thinks Custom ’Us, Jack? said the landlord.
I do, said the Jack.
Then you’re wrong, Jack.
Done with their buttons? returned the Jack.
Chucked ’em overboard.
Sowed ’em, to come up small salad.
This dialogue made us all uneasy, and me very uneasy.
We were up early.
Again our charge was the least anxious of the party.
We spoke very little.
He complied, and I went on alone.
Not a word was spoken in either boat.
That’s the man, wrapped in the cloak.
His name is Abel Magwitch, otherwise Provis.
That he would be leniently treated, I could not hope.
I had gone direct to Mr.
Jaggers on the prisoner’s behalf would admit nothing.
I imparted to Mr.
I understood that very well.
Jaggers, of the possessions he supposed I should inherit.
You will be so lonely.
I have not leisure to think of that, said I.
I will, said I.
Two or three months at most.
And Clara? said I.
Whimple confides to me that he is certainly going.
You don’t blame me, I hope, Mr.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Yes, to be sure, said Wemmick.
But what I look at is this.
Whereas, the portable property certainly could have been saved.
He accepted the invitation.
These twelve years, more likely, said Wemmick.
I’m going to take a holiday.
More than that; I’m going to take a walk.
It ain’t a long walk, and it’s an early one.
Why, we are not going fishing! said I.
No, returned Wemmick, but I like to walk with one.
Halloa! said he.
Halloa! said Wemmick.
Here’s Miss Skiffins! Let’s have a wedding.
It was pleasant to observe that Mrs.
Thankee! said Wemmick, rubbing his hands.
She’s such a manager of fowls, you have no idea.
You shall have some eggs, and judge for yourself.
I say, Mr.
Pip! calling me back, and speaking low.
This is altogether a Walworth sentiment, please.
Not to be mentioned in Little Britain, said I.
After what you let out the other day, Mr.
Jaggers may as well not know of it.
When the Sessions came round, Mr.
The trial was very short and very clear.
Then the Judge addressed them.
Nobody was hard with him or with me.
But I knowed you couldn’t be that.
It is just the time, said I.
I waited for it at the gate.
Not to lose a moment of the time.
Thank’ee dear boy, thank’ee.
God bless you! You’ve never deserted me, dear boy.
That’s best of all.
He lay on his back, breathing with great difficulty.
You never do complain.
He had spoken his last words.
Dear Magwitch, I must tell you now, at last.
You had a child once, whom you loved and lost.
A stronger pressure on my hand.
She lived, and found powerful friends.
She is living now.
She is a lady and very beautiful.
What is the debt? Hundred and twenty-three pound, fifteen, six.
Jeweller’s account, I think.
I keep a very nice house.
I made some attempt to get up and dress myself.
I still lay there.
You see my state, said I.
Whoever came about me, still settled down into Joe.
Strike me, Joe.
Tell me of my ingratitude.
It’s the end of May, Pip.
To-morrow is the first of June.
Evidently Biddy had taught Joe to write.
Miss Georgiana, she have twenty pound down.
Old Orlick he’s been a bustin’ open a dwelling-ouse.
Whose? said I.
But he knowed Orlick, and Orlick’s in the county jail.
By these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation.
There was no change whatever in Joe.
So it was.
Astonishing! said Joe, in the placidest way.
Which? Him as sent the bank-notes, Pip? Yes.
Lookee here, old chap, said Joe, bending over me.
Lookee here, old chap, said Joe.
I noticed that.
The man says, Joe assented.
Well, old chap, said Joe, then abide by your words.
Now, you shall see me walk back by myself.
Joe gave it me, but was thoughtful.
It was a thoughtful evening with both of us.
Dear old Pip, old chap, you’re a’most come round, sir.
It has been a memorable time for me, Joe.
Likeways for myself, sir, Joe returned.
And, dear sir, what have been betwixt us—have been.
I would tell him before breakfast.
I went to his room, and he was not there.
Ever the best of friends.
Such was my purpose.
Pumblechook conversing with the landlord.
William, said Mr.
Pumblechook to the waiter, put a muffin on table.
William, said Mr.
Pumblechook, mournfully, put the salt on.
Sugar and milk.
William, bring a watercress.
Thank you, said I, shortly, but I don’t eat watercresses.
You don’t eat ’em, returned Mr.
The simple fruits of the earth.
You needn’t bring any, William.
I went on with my breakfast, and Mr.
Little more than skin and bone! mused Mr.
Hah! he went on, handing me the bread and butter.
You are right, young man.
For once you are right.
The waiter appeared to be particularly affected.
You do not, sir, said William.
I swear I don’t see him here, said I.
Say that likewise, retorted Pumblechook.
There you quite mistake him, said I.
I know better.
_He_ knows it, Joseph, as none can.
It pinted out this writing, Joseph.
Not at all.
The June weather was delicious.
But dear Biddy, how smart you are! Yes, dear Pip.
No, I couldn’t indeed, said Biddy.
But I must say more.
Nor Biddy ain’t.
Nor yet no one ain’t.
No, no, said Biddy, gently.
You must marry.
I am already quite an old bachelor.
Tell me as an old, old friend.
Yes, even so.
For Estella’s sake.
The figure showed itself aware of me, as I advanced.
It had been moving towards me, but it stood still.
I wonder you know me.
The ground belongs to me.
It is the only possession I have not relinquished.
Is it to be built on? At last, it is.
I have often thought of you, said Estella.
Have you? Of late, very often.
And we were silent again until she spoke.
I am very glad to do so.
And will continue friends apart, said Estella.
But, fortunately, Adelaïda Ivanovna’s family intervened and circumvented his greediness.
But, who knows, it may have been simplicity.
And we ourselves are, too.
He spent an irregular boyhood and youth.
He seems not to have liked his father.
His second marriage lasted eight years.
So the poor child exchanged a benefactress for a benefactor.
She gave them nothing and cursed them both.
They were completely forgotten and abandoned by their father.
God has punished her for her ingratitude.
It was evening.
I beg the reader to note this from the beginning.
It was rather a curious incident.
He had come from Paris, which was his permanent home.
That is how it was with him.
He was dreamy, for instance, and rather solitary.
On the contrary he was bright and good‐tempered.
He never tried to show off among his schoolfellows.
He never resented an insult.
This characteristic was a wild fanatical modesty and chastity.
He did not finish his studies at the gymnasium.
They were sorry and unwilling to let him go.
He was more and more frequently drunk.
I have mentioned already that he looked bloated.
He slobbered every time he began to speak.
He seemed proud of it.
Would you believe it? You were making straight for it.
Well, to be sure you have your own two thousand.
That’s a dowry for you.
And I’ll never desert you, my angel.
Thirty women, I believe.
I have been there myself.
The worst of it is it’s awfully Russian.
There are no French women there.
If they get to hear of it they’ll come along.
They keep the fasts.
I admit it....
My dear boy, I’m awfully stupid about that.
You wouldn’t believe it.
though you’re like an angel, nothing touches you.
And I dare say nothing will touch you there.
You’ve got all your wits about you.
And I will wait for you.
My dear boy, I feel it, you know.
I can’t help feeling it.
And he even began blubbering.
He was sentimental.
He was wicked and sentimental.
It is not miracles that dispose realists to belief.
I’ll simply repeat what I have said above.
It flourished especially in the celebrated Kozelski Optin Monastery.
Only after this could the funeral take place.
This, of course, is only an old legend.
But here is a recent instance.
The elder Zossima was sixty‐five.
No doubt he liked to do so.
On the contrary, he was always almost gay.
He is holy.
That was the dream in Alyosha’s heart.
Alyosha noticed it with some embarrassment.
He knew for certain that his brother was an atheist.
The pretext for this gathering was a false one.
Alyosha was well aware of that.
Though he said nothing, Alyosha thoroughly understood his father.
He awaited the day with a heavy heart.
But his chief anxiety concerned the elder.
Alyosha was not greatly cheered by the letter.
This young man was preparing to enter the university.
The young man was still undecided.
He was thoughtful and absent‐minded.
He was nice‐ looking, strongly built, and rather tall.
There was a strange fixity in his gaze at times.
But his animation vanished as quickly as it appeared.
He was a friend of Alyosha’s.
He looked about him with curiosity, together with assumed ease.
They were all staying at the hotel.
Yet no official personage met them.
His liberal irony was rapidly changing almost into anger.
He at once entered into our visitors’ difficulty.
It is a long time since we’ve been here.
Come with me, won’t you? I’ll show you.
I have to go....
I am going myself.
This way, this way.
His eyes looked starting out of his head.
I’ve been there.
Who is a _chevalier_? asked Miüsov.
Fyodor Pavlovitch and Miüsov stopped.
At one o’clock, not later.
And you also, he added, addressing Maximov.
Yes, Dmitri Fyodorovitch is non‐existent as yet.
Thank the Father Superior, he said to the monk.
The Father Superior is engaged just now.
But as you please— the monk hesitated.
He’s like von Sohn, Fyodor Pavlovitch said suddenly.
Is that all you can think of?...
It’s not the features, but something indefinable.
He’s a second von Sohn.
I can always tell from the physiognomy.
Ah, I dare say you are a connoisseur in that.
I advise you to control yourself.
Miüsov frowned more than ever.
Here’s the hermitage.
We’ve arrived, cried Fyodor Pavlovitch.
The gates are shut.
Here in this hermitage there are twenty‐five saints being saved.
They look at one another, and eat cabbages.
And not one woman goes in at this gate.
That’s what is remarkable.
And that really is so.
They are always outside the precincts.
Don’t suppose, holy father, that I mean any harm.
They’ll turn you out when I’m gone.
But I’m not interfering with you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch.
He never thrashed any one, answered the monk.
I’m surprised at you.
But Miüsov had no time to reply to this sarcasm.
They were asked to come in.
He walked in, somewhat irritated.
His expression was one of unquestioning, but self‐respecting, reverence.
Father Zossima was accompanied by a novice, and by Alyosha.
He stood in front of the other visitors.
Fyodor Pavlovitch did the same, mimicking Miüsov like an ape.
The blood rushed to Alyosha’s cheeks.
He was ashamed.
His forebodings were coming true.
The divinity student, the novice, and Alyosha remained standing.
At the first moment he did not like Zossima.
He had a sprinkling of gray hair about his temples.
He felt altogether dissatisfied with his position.
Yes; that’s true.
But, there! I always say the wrong thing.
It’s their liver.
He stood there so glum.
Always injuring myself with my politeness.
I’m always injuring myself like that.
You’re doing it now, muttered Miüsov, with disgust.
Father Zossima scrutinized them both in silence.
I dare say it’s a devil within me.
But only a little one.
A more serious one would have chosen another lodging.
But now I sit and await words of wisdom.
I’m like the philosopher, Diderot, your reverence.
Princess Dashkov was his godmother, and Potyomkin his godfather.
But I’ll tell you the whole truth, gentlemen.
I never thought of it before.
I made it up to add piquancy.
I play the fool, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, to make myself agreeable.
I heard your aunt, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, tell the story.
Miüsov got up, forgetting himself in his impatience.
He was furious, and conscious of being ridiculous.
What was taking place in the cell was really incredible.
Many remained kneeling during the whole visit.
Alyosha stood, with hanging head, on the verge of tears.
He alone in the monastery knew Rakitin’s thoughts.
Don’t distress yourself, I beg.
I beg you not to disturb yourself.
I particularly beg you to be my guest.
Do not trouble.
Make yourself quite at home.
Don’t risk it....
I will not go so far as that myself.
I warn you for your own sake.
I mean that for you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch.
So I say, ‘Let me really play the buffoon.
And close your taverns.
If you can’t close all, at least two or three.
And, above all—don’t lie.
You mean about Diderot? No, not about Diderot.
Above all, don’t lie to yourself.
But get up, sit down, I beg you.
All this, too, is deceitful posturing....
Blessed man! Give me your hand to kiss.
It is, it is pleasant to take offense.
Though I believe I am not the father of lies.
I am getting mixed in my texts.
Say, the son of lies, and that will be enough.
my angel ...
Only do tell Pyotr Alexandrovitch not to interrupt me.
I do not know what saint.
I do not know, and can’t tell.
I was deceived.
I was told the story.
He it was who told the story.
It was three years ago.
Yet Miüsov was stung by his words.
What nonsense, and it is all nonsense, he muttered.
but not to you.
I was told it myself.
I heard it in Paris from a Frenchman.
The elder suddenly rose from his seat.
I have visitors awaiting me who arrived before you.
He went out of the cell.
Blessed man! he cried, with feeling.
Allow me to kiss your hand once more.
I’ll sit in a chair and hold my tongue.
Now it is for you to speak, Pyotr Alexandrovitch.
You are the principal person left now—for ten minutes.
She was rather pale, and had lively black eyes.
Her daughter, a girl of fourteen, was partially paralyzed.
He too sought the elder’s blessing.
One crazy woman was led up to him.
He blessed them all and talked with some of them.
The possessed woman he knew already.
But here is one from afar.
It withdraws into itself and is still.
This is particularly common with women.
But it is no lighter a grief than the silent.
Lamentations comfort only by lacerating the heart still more.
Such grief does not desire consolation.
It feeds on the sense of its hopelessness.
Townfolk we are, Father, townfolk.
Yet we are peasants though we live in the town.
He was three years old—three years all but three months.
He was the last one left.
He seems always standing before me.
He never leaves me.
He has withered my heart.
I look at them and wail.
It’s all our own, the horse and the carriage.
He’s sure to.
It used to be so before.
But now I don’t think about him.
It’s three months since I left home.
I’ve forgotten him.
I’ve forgotten everything.
I don’t want to remember.
I’ve done with them all.
She sighed deeply.
I see that he cries like me.
‘I know, Nikita,’ said I.
Such is the lot set on earth for you mothers.
Be not comforted.
Consolation is not what you need.
Weep and be not consoled, but weep.
What was his name? Alexey, Father.
A sweet name.
After Alexey, the man of God? Yes, Father.
It is a sin for you to leave him.
But then he will send you gentle dreams.
Go to your husband, mother; go this very day.
I will go, Father, at your word.
I will go.
You’ve gone straight to my heart.
Only I am in doubt....
It’s shameful to ask the question.
Only for your ignorance it is forgiven you.
And another thing I will tell you, Prohorovna.
Go, and henceforward be in peace.
Your son is alive, I tell you.
Her eyes besought him, but she seemed afraid to approach.
I have sinned, Father.
I am afraid of my sin.
The elder sat down on the lower step.
The woman crept closer to him, still on her knees.
I had a hard life with my husband.
He was an old man.
He used to beat me cruelly.
She had soon done.
Three years ago? asked the elder.
Have you come from far? Over three hundred miles away.
Have you told it in confession? I have confessed it.
Twice I have confessed it.
Have you been admitted to Communion? Yes.
I am afraid.
I am afraid to die.
Fear nothing and never be afraid; and don’t fret.
If only your penitence fail not, God will forgive all.
Go, and fear not.
Be not bitter against men.
Be not angry if you are wronged.
Be reconciled with him in truth.
If you are penitent, you love.
And if you love you are of God.
She bowed down to the earth without speaking.
From Vyshegorye, dear Father.
Five miles you have dragged yourself with the baby.
What do you want? I’ve come to look at you.
They told us you were ill.
Thinks I, I’ll go and see him for myself.
Here are sixty copecks.
Give them, dear Father, to some one poorer than me.
I thought as I came along, better give through him.
He’ll know whom to give to.
Thanks, my dear, thanks! You are a good woman.
I love you.
I will do so certainly.
Is that your little girl? My little girl, Father, Lizaveta.
Farewell, dear children, farewell, dear ones.
He blessed them all and bowed low to them.
She could not go on for emotion.
Oh, I understand the people’s love for you.
I love the people myself.
I want to love them.
We have come, great healer, to express our ardent gratitude.
And that’s not all.
Her legs are stronger.
I’ve called in Doctor Herzenstube.
His eyes shone and he looked down.
She has a message for you, Alexey Fyodorovitch.
Lise assumed an important air.
Katerina Ivanovna has sent you this through me.
She handed him a little note.
His face at once looked anxious.
Why, of course, I can’t say.
But she wants to see you at once.
And you will go to her, of course.
It is a Christian duty.
I told mamma you’d be sure not to go.
I said you were saving your soul.
How splendid you are! I’ve always thought you were splendid.
But the elder was no longer watching him.
He was referring to her healing.
It’s too early, of course, to speak of that.
It’s all from God.
Visit me, Father, he added to the monk.
It’s not often I can see visitors.
Oh, no, no! God will not take you from us.
I am extraordinarily better to‐day.
But I know that it’s only for a moment.
I understand my disease now thoroughly.
You seem to pierce with your words.
From what specially? I suffer ...
from lack of faith.
And now I am so bold as to ask you.
I quite believe in the sincerity of your suffering.
It’s deadly—deadly! No doubt.
How? By the experience of active love.
Strive to love your neighbor actively and indefatigably.
This has been tried.
This is certain.
I would nurse the afflicted.
I would be ready to kiss such wounds.
Sometime, unawares, you may do a good deed in reality.
That’s the chief question—that’s my most agonizing question.
Otherwise I am incapable of loving any one.
‘I love humanity,’ he said, ‘but I wonder at myself.
It is enough that you are distressed at it.
You have revealed me to myself.
Avoid being scornful, both to others and to yourself.
Never be frightened at your own faint‐heartedness in attaining love.
Don’t be frightened overmuch even at your evil actions.
They are waiting for me.
The lady was weeping.
Lise, Lise! Bless her—bless her! she cried, starting up suddenly.
She does not deserve to be loved.
She waited intently to catch his eye.
Alyosha was even more disconcerted and vexed.
Her eyes flashed and her face became quite serious.
We used to play together.
We know that he goes everywhere.
It’s not good manners for me to invite him.
Don’t be angry with me.
I’m silly and good for nothing ...
I will certainly send him, said the elder.
But he was unsuccessful in this also.
On the contrary, I’m just going.
What object? Alyosha watched him intently.
But in what sense? Father Zossima asked Ivan.
To play with such words is indefensible.
For that we have the divine promise.
He ceased speaking suddenly, as though checking himself.
In reality this was bound to happen.
That is the gist of my article.
That’s as you please.
Are you serious? Miüsov glanced keenly at him.
Some sort of dream again.
Something shapeless and even incomprehensible.
You must admit that.
She can enter into no compact about that.
So it seems at least in Lutheran countries.
You can judge for yourself how it must end.
What strikes you as so strange? Father Iosif inquired cautiously.
That is Rome and its dream.
That is the third temptation of the devil.
His whole figure expressed extraordinary personal dignity.
A supercilious and condescending smile played on his lips.
Alyosha watched it all with a throbbing heart.
The whole conversation stirred him profoundly.
But I thoroughly understood him.
These are the people we are most afraid of.
He was muscular, and showed signs of considerable physical strength.
Yet there was something not healthy in his face.
There were several stories current in the town about it.
He wore black gloves and carried a top‐hat.
He had the long, determined stride of a military man.
He made him a low bow, and asked his blessing.
Father Zossima, rising in his chair, blessed him.
Now I suddenly learn— Don’t disturb yourself, interposed the elder.
You are a little late.
It’s of no consequence....
Saying this, Dmitri bowed once more.
It’s a subtle question, too.
Here Ivan Fyodorovitch is smiling at us.
He must have something interesting to say about that also.
Nothing special, except one little remark, Ivan replied at once.
This wild notion is, of course, a characteristic feature.
Your Paris anecdote is rather to the point, Pyotr Alexandrovitch.
That’s not all.
I’ll remember it.
Every one looked at him with curiosity.
That was my contention.
There is no virtue if there is no immortality.
You are blessed in believing that, or else most unhappy.
Why unhappy? Ivan asked smiling.
Perhaps you are right! ...
You were not altogether joking.
The question is still fretting your heart, and not answered.
His face looked firm and earnest.
But Miüsov suddenly shrugged his shoulders.
He too leapt up.
Forgive it, reverend Father, he added, addressing the elder.
All my father wants is a scandal.
Why he wants it only he can tell.
He always has some motive.
Pyotr Alexandrovitch here blames me too.
The whole town is echoing with his debaucheries.
I’ll prove it....
He’s continually borrowing money for the purpose.
Mitya! Mitya! cried Fyodor Pavlovitch hysterically, squeezing out a tear.
Father, I don’t justify my action.
She told me the story and laughed at you....
He could not go on.
His eyes were glittering and he breathed with difficulty.
But every one in the cell was stirred.
All except Father Zossima got up from their seats uneasily.
At last Miüsov felt completely humiliated and disgraced.
with pistols, at three paces ...
across a handkerchief, he ended, stamping with both feet.
I thought ...
He had been silent till that moment.
He spoke evenly and deliberately.
Father Zossima rose suddenly from his seat.
There was a faint smile on his lips.
Dmitri stood for a few moments in amazement.
Reverend Father, kindly do me a favor.
I will decline, and not you.
I’ll prove it by the church calendar.
As for you, Ivan, stay if you like.
I’ll send the horses for you later.
Mine is that of the little dog Fido.
Why not? I was especially invited yesterday.
Besides, father won’t be there, observed Ivan.
The monk listened in silence.
He received no answer.
Miüsov looked with hatred at Ivan.
It was a little room furnished with the bare necessities.
The elder sank exhausted on the bed.
His eyes glittered and he breathed hard.
He looked intently at Alyosha, as though considering something.
Go, my dear boy, go.
Porfiry is enough for me.
Let me stay here, Alyosha entreated.
You are more needed there.
There is no peace there.
You will wait, and be of service.
If evil spirits rise up, repeat a prayer.
Go away for good.
I bless you for great service in the world.
Yours will be a long pilgrimage.
And you will have to take a wife, too.
You will have to bear _all_ before you come back.
There will be much to do.
Christ is with you.
Do not abandon Him and He will not abandon you.
Work, work unceasingly.
Alyosha’s face again betrayed strong emotion.
The corners of his mouth quivered.
What is it again? Father Zossima asked, smiling gently.
We rejoice and pray for him.
Leave me, I must pray.
Go, and make haste.
Be near your brothers.
And not near one only, but near both.
Father Zossima raised his hand to bless him.
But evidently it was not his will.
Mysterious, and perhaps awful.
Alyosha believed that implicitly.
He had not far to go—about five hundred paces.
He was waiting for some one.
Are you waiting for me? asked Alyosha, overtaking him.
Yes, grinned Rakitin.
What vision? That bowing to your brother, Dmitri.
But there was an object in the performance.
Your house stinks of it.
It’ll be in your family, this crime.
Between your brothers and your rich old father.
Rakitin stopped, too.
That’s interesting, too, by the way.
Have you thought of it or not? Answer.
I have, answered Alyosha in a low voice.
Even Rakitin was taken aback.
What? Have you really? he cried.
Two questions, disconnected, but natural.
I’ll deal with them separately.
I caught the whole man from one trait.
No, Misha, no.
If that’s all, you’ve reassured me.
It won’t come to that.
That’s the very definition and inner essence of him.
It’s your father has handed him on his low sensuality.
You are mistaken about that woman.
Dmitri—despises her, said Alyosha, with a sort of shudder.
Grushenka? No, brother, he doesn’t despise her.
He does, but he can’t tear himself away.
I understand that, Alyosha jerked out suddenly.
That escaped you unawares, and the confession’s the more precious.
I’ve been watching you a long time.
‘I’ll pull off his cassock,’ she says.
I wondered why she took such an interest in you.
Finish what you were saying, Misha.
I’ll tell you my idea after.
There’s nothing to finish.
It’s all clear.
It’s the same old tune, brother.
And what’s more, it’s with Mitya’s consent.
He has suddenly gone crazy over Grushenka.
His mouth waters at the sight of her.
It would suit him down to the ground.
She’s hesitating between the two of them already.
You don’t like Ivan.
Ivan wouldn’t be tempted by money.
Ivan is above that.
He wouldn’t make up to any one for thousands.
It is not money, it’s not comfort Ivan is seeking.
Perhaps it’s suffering he is seeking.
His mind is in bondage.
He is haunted by a great, unsolved doubt.
That’s plagiarism, Alyosha.
You’re quoting your elder’s phrases.
His face changed, and his lips twitched.
And the problem’s a stupid one.
It is no good guessing it.
Rack your brains—you’ll understand it.
His article is absurd and ridiculous.
You are clever but ...
never mind, I was silly to smile.
I understand your getting hot about it, Misha.
I am not going to insult you.
He doesn’t speak of you at all.
You are pleased to be sarcastic, too, Alexey Fyodorovitch.
No, no, I’m joking, forgive me.
I’ve something quite different in my mind.
Oh, yes, I’d forgotten she was a relation of yours.
I beg you to understand that! Rakitin was intensely irritated.
Forgive me, for goodness’ sake, I had no idea ...
how can you call her a harlot? Is she ...
that sort of woman? Alyosha flushed suddenly.
That’s not your business.
Well, here we are.
You’d better go to the kitchen.
Here’s your father and your brother Ivan after him.
They’ve broken out from the Father Superior’s.
And your father’s shouting and waving his arms.
I expect he’s swearing.
Bah, and there goes Miüsov driving away in his carriage.
You see, he’s going.
And there’s old Maximov running!—there must have been a row.
There can’t have been any dinner.
There had been a scandalous, an unprecedented scene.
It had all come from the impulse of a moment.
There was no vodka.
He had a footing everywhere, and got information about everything.
He was of an uneasy and envious temper.
They were already waiting when Miüsov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived.
The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also.
He bowed to his guests in silence.
But this time they approached to receive his blessing.
in fact, quite unseemly ...
In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later.
He fully and sincerely loved humanity again.
Pray be seated, gentlemen.
He has done me no harm.
His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.
So let me shame them for all I am worth.
No! this I cannot endure! he cried.
I absolutely cannot! and ...
I certainly cannot! The blood rushed to his head.
No, no, it is impossible! cried Miüsov, beside himself.
That is why I came.
I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywhere now.
That’s right, isn’t it, von Sohn? Here’s von Sohn.
Of course I mean you, cried Fyodor Pavlovitch.
Who else? The Father Superior could not be von Sohn.
But I am not von Sohn either.
I am Maximov.
No, you are von Sohn.
So this is that very von Sohn.
Let us go, cried Miüsov, addressing Kalganov.
Allow me to finish.
My son, Alexey, is here, being saved.
Holy Father, I am indignant with you.
He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders.
How disgraceful! cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.
Pardon me! said the Father Superior.
Tut—tut—tut—sanctimoniousness and stock phrases! Old phrases and old gestures.
The old lies and formal prostrations.
We know all about them.
I don’t like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth.
I can talk sense, too, Father Superior.
Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers.
Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon.
This is too disgraceful! said Father Iosif.
Father Païssy kept obstinately silent.
Miüsov rushed from the room, and Kalganov after him.
You may beg me on your knees, I shan’t come.
He he he! No, I’ll say no more.
He was so touched he was almost weeping.
Bethink yourselves, Fathers, I will go.
It is fun there.
I’ve cloudberry wine.
Hey, von Sohn, don’t lose your chance.
He went out, shouting and gesticulating.
Maximov suddenly appeared by the side of the carriage.
He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late.
Rakitin and Alyosha saw him running.
Take me, too.
There! cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delighted.
Did I not say he was von Sohn.
It is von Sohn himself, risen from the dead.
It will be fun.
He can lie somewhere at our feet.
It was quite by chance he did not fall.
Drive on! Ivan shouted angrily to the coachman.
But the carriage had already driven away.
Ivan made no reply.
Well, you are a fellow, Fyodor Pavlovitch said again.
You urged it, you approved of it.
Why are you angry now? You’ve talked rot enough.
You might rest a bit now, Ivan snapped sullenly.
Fyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.
You shall have some, too, when we get home.
Ivan was still silent.
Fyodor Pavlovitch waited another two minutes.
And they did not speak again all the way home.
Of these three we must say a few words.
Of old Grigory we have said something already.
He was honest and incorruptible.
Do you understand what duty is? he asked Marfa Ignatyevna.
Well, don’t understand then.
But so it shall be.
And you hold your tongue.
And so it was.
It was true, and he was aware of it.
He knew his weaknesses and was afraid of them.
It was almost a morbid condition.
God had not blessed them with children.
One child was born but it died.
The baby had six fingers.
Why not? asked the priest with good‐humored surprise.
Because it’s a dragon, muttered Grigory.
They laughed, and of course christened the poor baby.
Yet he did not interfere in any way.
He rarely read aloud, only perhaps in Lent.
He was perhaps predisposed to mysticism.
She was frightened and waked her husband.
He got up and dressed.
It was a rather warm night in May.
She lay dying with the baby beside her.
But her story needs a chapter to itself.
Her mother had long been dead.
Every one was kind to her and gave her something.
She herself never tasted anything but black bread and water.
She scarcely ever went to church.
They all pronounced with lofty repugnance that it was impossible.
At the time, Grigory stood up for his master vigorously.
She was better looked after than ever.
They saved the baby, but Lizaveta died at dawn.
Nurse him and weep no more.
So Marfa brought up the child.
The townspeople were pleased at his adopting the foundling.
He was employed as cook.
That was not his way.
He was afraid of that woman, Katerina Ivanovna.
He thought of her as a beautiful, proud, imperious girl.
And the vagueness of his apprehension increased the apprehension itself.
The girl’s aims were of the noblest, he knew that.
And so his conversation would be with her alone.
Standing still for a minute, he reached a final decision.
He knew her house.
Alyosha ran up to the hurdle.
It’s a good thing you looked up.
There’s no one here.
Why do you whisper? asked Alyosha.
You see what silly tricks nature plays one.
I am here in secret, and on the watch.
Let us go.
Till then be quiet.
I want to kiss you.
I was just repeating that, sitting here, before you came.
There were apple‐trees, maples, limes and birch‐trees.
God knows when this summer‐house was built.
That’s brandy, Mitya laughed.
I see your look: ‘He’s drinking again!’ Distrust the apparition.
Distrust the worthless, lying crowd, And lay aside thy doubts.
But being in love doesn’t mean loving.
Remember that! I can talk about it gayly still.
And I’m not afraid, and don’t you be afraid.
At least, I am afraid, but I enjoy it.
It’s not enjoyment though, but ecstasy.
To send an angel.
But be quiet, be quiet for a time.
Don’t be sorry, and don’t cry.
Alyosha took it out of his pocket.
Mitya looked through it quickly.
You are an angel on earth.
You will hear and judge and forgive.
Make haste! H’m!...
There’s no need to hurry now.
Now the world has taken a new turning.
Ah, Alyosha, what a pity you can’t understand ecstasy.
He felt that, perhaps, indeed, his work lay here.
Both were silent.
Alyosha, said Mitya, you’re the only one who won’t laugh.
Don’t think I’m talking nonsense because I’m drunk.
I’m not a bit drunk.
Don’t be uneasy.
I’m not spinning it out.
I won’t keep you in suspense.
Mitya broke into sobs and seized Alyosha’s hand.
My dear, my dear, in degradation, in degradation now, too.
I pray God I’m not lying and showing off.
I don’t kiss her.
I don’t cleave to her bosom.
Has it reformed me? Never! For I’m a Karamazov.
Let me be accursed.
But enough poetry! I am in tears; let me cry.
It may be foolishness that every one would laugh at.
But you won’t laugh.
Your eyes are shining, too.
To insects—sensual lust.
Yes, man is broad, too broad, indeed.
I’d have him narrower.
But a man always talks of his own ache.
Listen, now to come to facts.
I entertained them both.
I am speaking figuratively, brother.
If you were like me, you’d know what that means.
I loved vice, I loved the ignominy of vice.
She allowed me, she allowed me much in the dark.
Now they live happily.
Observe that I told no one.
I didn’t boast of it.
You’re blushing; your eyes flashed.
Enough of this filth with you.
I’ve a perfect album of reminiscences, brother.
God bless them, the darlings.
I tried to break it off without quarreling.
And I never gave them away.
I never bragged of one of them.
But that’s enough.
You say that because I blushed, Alyosha said suddenly.
I blushed because I am the same as you are.
The ladder’s the same.
That’s how I see it.
But it’s all the same.
Absolutely the same in kind.
Then one ought not to step on at all.
Any one who can help it had better not.
But can you? I think not.
That rogue Grushenka has an eye for men.
She told me once that she’d devour you one day.
You’re the first, except Ivan, of course—Ivan knows everything.
He knew about it long before you.
But Ivan’s a tomb.
Ivan’s a tomb? Yes.
Alyosha listened with great attention.
Yet I was awfully well received in the little town.
I spent money right and left.
I was thought to be rich; I thought so myself.
Although they shook their heads over me, they liked me.
I was proud.
I like to say nice things about people.
She had not married, although she had had two suitors.
She refused them, but was as cheerful as ever.
I have often been friendly with women quite innocently.
She had a talent for it.
The colonel, of course, was a very different matter.
He was one of the chief personages in the district.
She had connections, and that was all.
She scarcely looked at me, and compressed her lips scornfully.
‘Wait a bit.
I’ll have my revenge,’ thought I.
I didn’t understand a word of it at the time.
But never mind that, we’ll talk of it later.
The authorities, I learnt, were dissatisfied with our lieutenant‐colonel.
Shortly afterwards he was ordered to retire.
I won’t tell you how it all happened.
He had enemies certainly.
His friends all turned their backs on him.
Then I took my first step.
‘Don’t frighten me!’ she said.
You know I’m as silent as the tomb.
I’ve just had money paid me.
But Agafya told her of our conversation.
I found that out afterwards.
Kravchenko declared that he really was ill.
The lieutenant‐colonel flew to him.
I heard all about this afterwards.
It’s strange how things happen sometimes.
Of course I grasped the position at once.
I have come ...
give me the money!’ She couldn’t keep it up.
I am telling it.
My first idea was a—Karamazov one.
You’ve seen her? She’s a beauty.
But she was beautiful in another way then.
She was hemmed in.
I could scarcely breathe.
For though I’m a man of base desires, I’m honest.
My spite was roused.
‘Four thousand! What do you mean? I was joking.
You’ve been counting your chickens too easily, madam.
Two hundred, if you like, with all my heart.
She’d have run away.
But it would have been an infernal revenge.
It would have been worth it all.
I did not keep her long, don’t be afraid.
She jumped up and ran away.
I was wearing my sword.
It would have been frightfully stupid, of course.
I suppose it was from delight.
So now Ivan knows of it, and you—no one else.
You understand the first half.
And I? Do you suppose I understand it? Stop, Dmitri.
There’s one important question.
It seemed to me caddish to make her an offer.
She only sent me about two hundred and sixty.
K.’ And that was all.
I’ll explain the rest now, in two words.
But that concerned the future.
She was an hysterical woman.
I saw something of her in Moscow, later.
I was speechless with surprise, as you may suppose.
Three days later came the promised letter.
I have it with me now.
You must read it.
She offers to be my wife, offers herself to me.
Be my husband.
Don’t be afraid.
I won’t hamper you in any way.
I will be your chattel.
I will be the carpet under your feet.
I want to love you for ever.
That letter stabs me even now.
I wrote to her with tears.
One thing I shall be ashamed of for ever.
I know that.
She loves her own _virtue_, not me.
The words broke involuntarily, and almost malignantly, from Dmitri.
That’s the tragedy of it—that I know that for certain.
I’ve been talking foolishly.
I’ve no words left.
Stop, Dmitri, Alyosha interrupted again with great anxiety.
The general’s wife blessed us, and—would you believe it?—congratulated Katya.
I had a lot of talk with Katya in Moscow.
I told her about myself—sincerely, honorably.
She listened to everything.
There was sweet confusion, There were tender words.
Though there were proud words, too.
She wrung out of me a mighty promise to reform.
To Grushenka, then! Alyosha exclaimed mournfully, clasping his hands.
I understand that.
They wanted to scare me.
I went to beat her.
I had had a glimpse of her before.
She doesn’t strike one at first sight.
I went to beat her, and I stayed.
The storm broke—it struck me down like the plague.
The cycle of the ages is accomplished.
That’s my position.
I sent the thousands flying.
He seemed all at once as though he were drunk.
His eyes became suddenly bloodshot.
And if she won’t, I shall stay all the same.
I’ll be the porter at her gate.
Alyosha! he cried.
I’ve forgotten it.
Here is your three thousand; he sends it back.
Send it yourself to Agafya Ivanovna.
But he told me to say he sends his compliments.
Don’t worry yourself to death with despair.
I shan’t shoot myself.
I haven’t the strength now.
But now I’m going to Grushenka.
I don’t care what happens.
Katerina Ivanovna will understand it all, Alyosha said solemnly.
She’ll understand how great this trouble is and will forgive.
She’ll see that for herself.
She won’t forgive everything, said Dmitri, with a grin.
There’s something in it, brother, that no woman could forgive.
Ivan will give you another thousand—that makes three.
Take it and pay it back.
To‐morrow is too late.
I shall send you to father.
To father? Yes, to father first.
Ask him for three thousand.
But, Mitya, he won’t give it.
As though he would! I know he won’t.
Do you know the meaning of despair, Alexey? Yes.
Legally he owes me nothing.
I’ve had it all from him, I know that.
Tell him God Himself sends him this chance.
Mitya, he won’t give it for anything.
I know he won’t.
I know it perfectly well.
That’s not all.
I know something more.
He knows her nature; he knows the cat.
I can tell you more than that.
For her? Yes, for her.
He does jobs for them.
I’ve established myself in his room.
No one but Smerdyakov knows, then? No one else.
It was he told you about the money, then? Yes.
It’s a dead secret.
Even Ivan doesn’t know about the money, or anything.
It will take him two or three days.
She’s certain not to come, cried Mitya suddenly.
Smerdyakov thinks so, too.
Father’s drinking now.
He’s sitting at table with Ivan.
Go to him, Alyosha, and ask for the three thousand.
I believe in miracles.
In miracles? In a miracle of Divine Providence.
God knows my heart.
He sees my despair.
He sees the whole picture.
Surely He won’t let something awful happen.
Alyosha, I believe in miracles.
Go! I am going.
Tell me, will you wait for me here? Yes.
I know it will take some time.
You can’t go at him point blank.
He’s drunk now.
I’ll wait three hours—four, five, six, seven.
I shall rush out and prevent it.
And if— If there’s an if, it will be murder.
I couldn’t endure it.
Who will be murdered? The old man.
I shan’t kill her.
Brother, what are you saying? Oh, I don’t know....
I don’t know.
Perhaps I shan’t kill, and perhaps I shall.
I feel a physical repulsion.
That’s what I’m afraid of.
That’s what may be too much for me.
I’ll go, Mitya.
And I will sit and wait for the miracle.
This had become a habit with him.
Fyodor Pavlovitch liked sweet things with brandy after dinner.
Ivan was also at table, sipping coffee.
The servants, Grigory and Smerdyakov, were standing by.
Fyodor Pavlovitch was roaring with laughter.
Coffee is a lenten dish, but it’s hot and good.
I don’t offer you brandy, you’re keeping the fast.
Here are the keys.
Look sharp! Alyosha began refusing the liqueur.
Though I should be pleased to have some hot coffee.
Bravo, my darling! He’ll have some coffee.
Does it want warming? No, it’s boiling.
It’s capital coffee: Smerdyakov’s making.
You must come one day and have some fish soup.
Let me know beforehand....
I’m so fond of him.
Alyosha, let me give you my blessing—a father’s blessing.
Alyosha rose, but Fyodor Pavlovitch had already changed his mind.
No, no, he said.
It’ll make you laugh.
Not that he was shy or bashful.
You’re not a human being.
Smerdyakov, it appeared afterwards, could never forgive him those words.
But this teaching came to nothing.
At the second or third lesson the boy suddenly grinned.
The boy looked sarcastically at his teacher.
There was something positively condescending in his expression.
Grigory could not restrain himself.
He at once gave Smerdyakov the key of the bookcase.
You shall be my librarian.
You’ll be better sitting reading than hanging about the courtyard.
He read a little but didn’t like it.
He did not once smile, and ended by frowning.
Why? Isn’t it funny? asked Fyodor Pavlovitch.
Smerdyakov did not speak.
Stay, here’s Smaragdov’s _Universal History_.
That’s all true.
But Smerdyakov did not get through ten pages of Smaragdov.
He thought it dull.
So the bookcase was closed again.
What is it? A beetle? Grigory would ask.
A fly, perhaps, observed Marfa.
Ach! What fine gentlemen’s airs! Grigory muttered, looking at him.
He looked extraordinarily old for his age.
His face had grown wrinkled, yellow, and strangely emasculate.
He turned out a first‐rate cook.
Fyodor Pavlovitch began to regard him rather differently.
Fyodor Pavlovitch left him with an impatient gesture.
He rarely spoke.
He stands, as it were, lost in thought.
Yet he is not thinking; he is contemplating.
How and why, of course, he does not know either.
There are a good many contemplatives among the peasantry.
The Controversy But Balaam’s ass had suddenly spoken.
The subject was a strange one.
Grigory had related the story at table.
How could it not be a sin? You’re talking nonsense.
He’s a rascal, that’s what he is! burst from Grigory.
He looked Smerdyakov wrathfully in the face.
But you’ve said that before.
Don’t waste words.
Prove it, cried Fyodor Pavlovitch.
Soup‐maker! muttered Grigory contemptuously.
He’s got this all up for your benefit.
He wants you to praise him.
Ivan listened with perfect seriousness to his father’s excited whisper.
Ivan, your ear again.
Ivan bent down again with a perfectly grave face.
I love you as I do Alyosha.
Don’t think I don’t love you.
He was watching Smerdyakov with great curiosity.
Or if there was sin, it was the most ordinary.
Stay! cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, in a transport of delight.
Then it must be so, if you agree.
I’m not talking about his faith.
I mean those two in the desert, only that idea.
But as to the rest you talk nonsense, nonsense, nonsense.
Over The Brandy The controversy was over.
Get along with you, Jesuits! he cried to the servants.
Go away, Smerdyakov.
Go to Marfa.
She’ll comfort you and put you to bed.
Smerdyakov always pokes himself in now, after dinner.
It’s you he’s so interested in.
Nothing whatever, answered Ivan.
Raw material for revolution, however, when the time comes.
For revolution? There will be others and better ones.
But there will be some like him as well.
His kind will come first, and better ones after.
He’s storing up ideas, said Ivan, smiling.
Worse still with Alyosha, he despises Alyosha.
He makes capital fish pasties too.
That I’ve always maintained.
Russia is rich in birches.
I stand up for the clever people.
And a good thing too.
But Russia’s all swinishness.
My dear, if you only knew how I hate Russia....
_Tout cela c’est de la cochonnerie_....
Do you know what I like? I like wit.
You’ve had another glass.
Wait a bit.
No, stay, you interrupted me.
So it quite suits the girls, too,’ he said.
I lost my temper.
You look sincere and you speak sincerely.
But not Ivan.
That Truth may prevail.
Ah! I dare say you’re right.
Why, am I like him now, then? Very much.
I want you to be serious now.
No, there is no God.
Alyosha, is there a God? There is.
None at all? None at all.
There’s absolute nothingness then.
Alyosha, is there immortality? There is.
God and immortality? God and immortality.
In God is immortality.
H’m! It’s more likely Ivan’s right.
It’s a pity.
Wouldn’t there have been? Without God? No.
And there would have been no brandy either.
But I must take your brandy away from you, anyway.
Stop, stop, stop, dear boy, one more little glass.
I’ve hurt Alyosha’s feelings.
I know your thoughts.
Your heart is better than your head.
Ivan, do you love Alyosha? Yes.
Listen, Alyosha, I was rude to your elder this morning.
But I was excited.
There is, there is.
But, of course, he believes in God.
Not a bit of it.
Didn’t you know? Why, he tells every one so, himself.
But I respect him.
Arbenin, or what’s his name?...
You see, he’s a sensualist.
You know, when he begins telling stories....
Especially how he once cured a paralyzed woman.
He did Dernidov, the merchant, out of sixty thousand.
‘You have given it to the Church,’ he declared.
I said to him: ‘You’re a scoundrel,’ I said.
I’ve muddled him with some one else ...
without noticing it.
Come, another glass and that’s enough.
Take away the bottle, Ivan.
I’ve been telling lies.
That’s a lie.
You did it from spite, from simple spite against me.
You despise me.
Well, I’m going away.
You’ve had too much brandy.
I’ll go to‐morrow if you’re so set upon it.
You won’t go.
You want to keep an eye on me.
That’s what you want, spiteful fellow.
That’s why you won’t go.
The old man persisted.
You’ve come here with some design.
Alyosha, here, looks at me and his eyes shine.
Alyosha doesn’t despise me.
Alexey, you mustn’t love Ivan.
Don’t be ill‐tempered with my brother.
Leave off attacking him, Alyosha said emphatically.
Oh, all right.
Ugh, my head aches.
Take away the brandy, Ivan.
It’s the third time I’ve told you.
Don’t be angry with a feeble old man, Ivan.
You’ve nothing to love me for.
You go to Tchermashnya.
I’ll come to you myself and bring you a present.
I’ll show you a little wench there.
I’ve had my eye on her a long time.
She’s still running about bare‐foot.
To my thinking ...
You’re not out of your shells yet.
Bare‐footed girls or unattractive ones, you must take by surprise.
It was peculiar to her.
I knew her attacks always used to begin like that.
‘You’ve taken a blow from him.
The holy Fathers prayed her back to reason.
Here it is.
Here I take it down.
fell all of a heap.
He flushed crimson, his eyes glowed, his lips quivered.
But she was my mother, too, I believe, his mother.
Was she not? said Ivan, with uncontrolled anger and contempt.
The old man shrank before his flashing eyes.
Your mother? he muttered, not understanding.
Excuse me, why, I was thinking, Ivan....
He he he! He stopped.
A broad, drunken, half‐senseless grin overspread his face.
The old man rushed to Ivan in terror.
She’s here! shouted Dmitri.
All his terror left him.
Hold him! Hold him! he cried, and dashed after Dmitri.
Ivan and Alyosha ran after their father.
At him! shouted the old man.
Ivan! Alyosha! She must be here.
He said he saw her himself, running.
He was choking.
He was trembling all over.
He seemed frantic.
But she may have come by that other entrance.
Dmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing‐room.
He’s been stealing money in my bedroom.
And tearing himself from Ivan he rushed again at Dmitri.
The old man moaned shrilly.
Madman! You’ve killed him! cried Ivan.
Serve him right! shouted Dmitri breathlessly.
Alexey! You tell me.
I shouted, she ran away.
But I saw her....
So she must ...
I’ll find out at once where she is....
Dmitri looked at him with hatred as he went out.
I don’t repent shedding your blood! he cried.
I curse you, and disown you altogether.
He ran out of the room.
She must be here.
They wrapped a wet towel round his head.
Ivan and Alyosha went back to the drawing‐room.
We’ll look after him.
My brother gave you a terrible blow—on the head.
He’s insulted me! Grigory articulated gloomily and distinctly.
I used to wash him in his tub.
He’s insulted me, repeated Grigory.
God forbid! cried Alyosha.
One reptile will devour the other.
And serve them both right, too.
My head’s begun to ache.
All at once his face betrayed extraordinary excitement.
Alyosha, he whispered apprehensively, where’s Ivan? In the yard.
He’s got a headache.
He’s on the watch.
Give me that looking‐glass.
It stands over there.
Give it me.
I’m more afraid of Ivan than the other.
You’re the only one I’m not afraid of....
Don’t be afraid of Ivan either.
He is angry, but he’ll defend you.
Alyosha, and what of the other? He’s run to Grushenka.
It was a mistake.
She has not been here.
You know Mitya wants to marry her, to marry her.
She won’t marry him.
Tears positively glittered in his eyes.
Take it home and keep it for yourself.
And I’ll let you go back to the monastery....
I was joking this morning, don’t be angry with me.
My head aches, Alyosha....
Alyosha, comfort my heart.
No, no, no.
I believe you.
She’s a deceitful, shameless hussy.
To Katerina Ivanovna.
For money? To ask her for money? No.
Not for money.
He’s no money; not a farthing.
Perhaps you’ll meet her....
Be sure to.
I have a word to say to you to‐morrow.
Will you come? Yes.
Don’t tell any one I told you to.
Don’t say a word to Ivan.
Good‐by, my angel.
You stood up for me, just now.
I shall never forget it.
He was sitting writing something in pencil in his note‐book.
His cordiality was a complete surprise to Alyosha.
Alyosha was disconcerted.
One can’t tell for certain.
Perhaps in nothing: it may all fizzle out.
That woman is a beast.
I don’t think Dmitri is capable of it, either.
Thanks, if only for that, smiled Ivan.
Be sure, I should always defend him.
Good‐by till to‐morrow.
They shook hands warmly as they had never done before.
There was something positively mysterious in it, too.
Alyosha knew that she lived with two aunts.
Possibly he had been noticed from the window.
He was conducted however to the drawing‐room at once.
There were many sofas, lounges, settees, big and little tables.
It was twilight and rather dark.
Alyosha saw that he had interrupted visitors, and frowned.
You’ll be happy with her, but perhaps—not tranquilly happy.
Quite so, brother.
Such people remain always the same.
They don’t yield to fate.
So you think I shan’t love her for ever.
No; perhaps you will love her for ever.
But perhaps you won’t always be happy with her.
He was conquered and captivated immediately.
I have come, muttered Alyosha confusedly, I—he sent me.
Ah, he sent you! I foresaw that.
Now I know everything—everything! cried Katerina Ivanovna, her eyes flashing.
I’ll tell you what I want from you.
I want to know your own last impression of him.
His compliments? Was that what he said—his own expression? Yes.
Katerina Ivanovna flushed hotly.
Help me now, Alexey Fyodorovitch.
Now I really need your help.
He had made his decision and was frightened at it.
The emphasis on that phrase may have been simply bravado.
Yes, yes! cried Alyosha warmly.
I believe that is it.
And, if so, he’s not altogether lost.
I can still save him.
He hadn’t sent the money, but I said nothing.
He can tell God everything without shame.
Let him forget me as his betrothed.
Tears gushed from her eyes.
He went to that woman, Alyosha added softly.
He won’t marry her because she won’t marry him.
Again Katerina Ivanovna laughed strangely.
He may marry her, said Alyosha mournfully, looking down.
He won’t marry her, I tell you.
That girl is an angel.
She is one of the most fantastic of fantastic creatures.
This is a friend.
This is Alyosha.
He knows all about our affairs.
Show yourself to him.
A violent revulsion passed over Alyosha.
Her feet made absolutely no sound on the floor.
The light in her eyes gladdened the soul—Alyosha felt that.
Yet it was a vigorous, ample body.
That could be divined.
She seemed quite in love with her.
I wanted to know her, to see her.
I knew we should settle everything together—everything.
Alyosha flushed, and faint, imperceptible shivers kept running down him.
We’re noble, we’re generous, Alexey Fyodorovitch, let me tell you.
We have only been unfortunate.
For the last five years she’s been wretched.
Perhaps there’s rather too much rapture, thought Alyosha.
He felt a peculiar uneasiness at heart the whole time.
Maybe I’m not so good as I seem to you.
I’ve a bad heart; I will have my own way.
I fascinated poor Dmitri Fyodorovitch that day simply for fun.
But now you’ll save him.
You’ve given me your word.
You’ll explain it all to him.
It was you kept talking about that.
I didn’t give you my word.
If I want to do a thing I do it.
I may have made you some promise just now.
You see, I’m so changeable.
Just now you said—something quite different, Katerina Ivanovna whispered faintly.
Ah, just now! But, you know.
I’m such a soft‐hearted, silly creature.
Well, but let that pass.
And then it shall be as God wills.
Katerina Ivanovna did not take her hand away.
Grushenka meanwhile seemed enthusiastic over the sweet hand.
She raised it deliberately to her lips.
As you please.
What’s the matter with you? said Katerina Ivanovna, starting suddenly.
There was a sudden gleam in her eyes.
She looked with awful intentness at Katerina Ivanovna.
Insolent creature! cried Katerina Ivanovna, as though suddenly grasping something.
She flushed all over and leapt up from her seat.
Grushenka too got up, but without haste.
Go away! You’re a creature for sale! screamed Katerina Ivanovna.
Every feature was working in her utterly distorted face.
You see, I know.
She’ll go away—she’ll go at once.
All hurried to her.
I got up this scene for your benefit, Alyosha.
See me home, dear, you’ll be glad of it afterwards.
Alyosha turned away, wringing his hands.
Grushenka ran out of the house, laughing musically.
Katerina Ivanovna went into a fit of hysterics.
She sobbed, and was shaken with convulsions.
Every one fussed round her.
I warned you, said the elder of her aunts.
I tried to prevent your doing this.
You’re too impulsive.
You are too self‐willed.
She’s a tigress! yelled Katerina Ivanovna.
But, my God! cried Katerina Ivanovna, clasping her hands.
His heart ached.
Don’t condemn me.
He could have wept as she did.
Suddenly he was overtaken by the maid.
Alyosha walked quickly along the road, at that hour deserted.
There were cross‐roads half‐way.
Come, tell me the truth.
Crush me like a beetle.
Oh, Dmitri! Father’s blood just now.
Look at the night.
I hid here under the willow waiting for you.
So there is a man, then, whom I love.
Damn it all, tell me what’s happened.
There was nothing like that, Mitya.
There—I found them both there.
Both? Whom? Grushenka at Katerina Ivanovna’s.
Dmitri was struck dumb.
Impossible! he cried.
He was ten minutes telling his story.
He literally shook with laughter.
For a long time he could not speak.
I understand the queen of impudence.
But Katerina Ivanovna! exclaimed Alyosha sorrowfully.
But her husband was caught stealing government money.
I was drunk, the gypsies were singing....
But I was sobbing.
She understood it all then.
I remember, she cried herself....
Damn it all! But it’s bound to be so now....
He looked down and sank into thought.
Come, that’s enough.
It’s no use talking! It’s not amusing.
You go your way and I mine.
Look at me.
Look at me well.
You see here, here—there’s terrible disgrace in store for me.
I can stop it or carry it through, note that.
Well, let me tell you, I shall carry it through.
I shan’t stop it.
But I shan’t pull up.
Darkness and destruction! No need to explain.
You’ll find out in due time.
The filthy back‐alley and the she‐ devil.
Don’t pray for me, I’m not worth it.
And there’s no need, no need at all....
Alyosha went towards the monastery.
Why, I shall certainly see him to‐morrow.
I shall look him up.
I shall make a point of it.
Here was holiness.
Some confessed kneeling.
Alyosha knew that this actually happened sometimes.
It’s difficult to rouse him.
And he must not be roused.
He intends to take the sacrament again in the morning.
He remembered you, Alexey.
Father Païssy went out.
That joy always brought him light untroubled sleep.
He was disturbed, but finished his prayer.
Then, after some hesitation, he opened the envelope.
Of course, on condition that you will leave the monastery.
There can be no doubt of that.
You see how I’ve thought of everything.
I’m always laughing and being naughty.
My secret is in your hands.
Here I’ve written you a love‐letter.
I shall certainly cry to‐day.
Good‐by till our meeting, our _awful_ meeting.—LISE.
P.S.—Alyosha! You must, must, must come!—LISE.
That laugh seemed to him sinful.
The agitation in his heart passed at once.
All ways are Thine.
Save them according to Thy wisdom.
Thou art love.
PART II Book IV.
Lacerations Father Ferapont Alyosha was roused early, before daybreak.
It wore an expression of gayety, kindness and cordiality.
He always confessed to Father Païssy.
After taking the communion, the service of extreme unction followed.
Meantime it was daylight.
People began coming from the monastery.
He talked as much as he could.
Though his voice was weak, it was fairly steady.
Alyosha remembered afterwards something of what he said to them.
Love God’s people.
Else he would have had no reason to come here.
Again I say, Be not proud.
Be proud neither to the little nor to the great.
Expound the Gospel to the people unceasingly ...
be not extortionate....
Do not love gold and silver, do not hoard them....
Cling to the banner and raise it on high.
Afterwards all remembered those words.
Father Païssy’s face looked the gravest of all.
All, all, ought to know of it! she concluded.
We shall see greater things! broke from him.
But it was just his craziness attracted them.
Father Ferapont never went to see the elder.
The water in his jug was changed every day.
He rarely appeared at mass.
He was not a priest, but a simple monk.
It was rather late in the evening.
A huge old elm was lightly rustling overhead.
There was an evening freshness in the air.
Get up! The monk got up.
Blessing, be blessed! Sit beside me.
There was no doubt he still had considerable strength.
He was of athletic build.
His eyes were gray, large and luminous, but strikingly prominent.
He spoke with a broad accent.
His throat and chest were bare.
From the little Obdorsk monastery, from St.
I have been at your Sylvester’s.
I used to stay there.
Is Sylvester well? The monk hesitated.
On Good Friday nothing is eaten.
It’s truly marvelous—your great abstinence.
And mushrooms? asked Father Ferapont, suddenly.
Mushrooms? repeated the surprised monk.
Haughty and unclean is their judgment.
Och, true, sighed the monk.
And have you seen devils among them? asked Ferapont.
Among them? Among whom? asked the monk, timidly.
You—can see spirits? the monk inquired.
And he died on the spot like a crushed spider.
It’s a year since I have been there.
I reveal it to you, as you are a stranger.
How does he speak, in what language? Human language.
You want to know too much, monk.
I do, blessed Father.
It happens at night.
Alyosha ran at once.
You see, you must go.
To you, dear son, because you love me.
But now go to keep your promise.
Alyosha immediately obeyed, though it was hard to go.
He spoke as they left the cell together.
Well, now go, my orphan.
With these words Father Païssy blessed him.
Why so? Alyosha wondered suddenly.
Alyosha went in.
Besides, I told you to come yesterday.
It’s all of no consequence.
You need not have troubled.
But I knew you’d come poking in directly.
He said this with almost hostile feeling.
Ivan’s gone out, he said suddenly.
He is doing his utmost to carry off Mitya’s betrothed.
Surely he did not tell you so? asked Alyosha.
Yes, he did, long ago.
You may as well know.
You can pray for my soul if you like.
Ivan talked well here yesterday, though we were all drunk.
nor education either.
Alyosha listened to him in silence.
I shouldn’t care about Ivan, but there’s another thing.
For that’s her way, everything by contraries.
No, thank you.
Only one little glass.
I’ll get it out of the cupboard.
One glass won’t kill me.
And I’ll crush Mitya like a beetle.
And your Mitya will squelch too.
_Your_ Mitya, for you love him.
But Ivan loves nobody.
Ivan is not one of us.
People like Ivan are not our sort, my boy.
They are like a cloud of dust.
When the wind blows, the dust will be gone....
It was a nonsensical idea of mine.
I’ll crush him like a beetle without it.
There’s nothing for you to do here, you needn’t stay.
You can go.
What’s that for? The old man was a little surprised.
Oh, I must succeed in finding him to‐day, whatever happens.
But Alyosha had not long to meditate.
He too had a satchel at his side.
Alyosha understood it by instinct.
All the others stared at Alyosha.
Give it him, hit him back, Smurov, they all shouted.
He aimed it at you, he meant it for you.
You are Karamazov, Karamazov! the boys shouted, laughing.
Both sides threw stones incessantly.
Many of the group had their pockets full too.
Three or four ceased throwing for a minute.
Krassotkin wouldn’t tell tales, but he must be thrashed.
But what for? I suppose you tease him.
It’s you he is throwing at now, not us.
He seemed to be the eldest.
Catch him up....
He is looking at you, the other boys chimed in.
Alyosha looked at them, and they at him.
Find out then, find out, cried the boys, laughing.
The boy waited for him without budging.
His bare arms stuck out beyond his sleeves.
I am alone, and there are six of them.
But I hit Smurov on the head! cried the boy.
The boy looked darkly at him.
I don’t know you.
Do you know me? Alyosha continued.
He was a full minute bandaging it.
The boy stood waiting all the time.
Just now he had not the time.
She ran out to Alyosha in the hall.
Then I shall see her here.
I know, I know all.
They both recognize it and revel in it.
And no wonder, Lise, no wonder ...
your caprices will make me hysterical too.
Mamma, I didn’t know he had come.
She was on the look‐out for you.
My darling mamma, it’s not at all clever of you.
Lise, you go too far.
I declare I shall have to be severe.
I can’t bear it.
A comedy, perhaps, not a tragedy.
I have hurt it, and it’s very painful.
Alyosha unbound his bitten finger.
The handkerchief was soaked with blood.
Madame Hohlakov screamed and shut her eyes.
Come, come here, she cried, imperiously.
Make haste, mamma, some water in a slop‐basin.
But do make haste, she finished nervously.
She was quite frightened at the sight of Alyosha’s wound.
Shouldn’t we send for Herzenstube? cried Madame Hohlakov.
Mamma, you’ll be the death of me.
Why, it’s nothing much, cried Alyosha, frightened at this alarm.
You see how bravely Alexey Fyodorovitch bears it.
This was all Lise was waiting for.
And then I’ll talk to you about something quite different.
Lise clasped her hands at his story.
That’s because your finger is in the water.
That’s not true, you have.
I knew you would say that.
You’ve got it in that pocket.
I’ve been regretting that joke all night.
Give me back the letter at once, give it me.
I’ve left it at home.
Why not? Because I believed all you said.
You are insulting me! Not at all.
I shall love you.
That scream drives me ...
My darling mamma, you begin to say really witty things.
That’s enough, mamma, enough about Herzenstube, Lise laughed gayly.
Make haste with the lint and the lotion, mamma.
Do you still feel the pain? It’s nothing much now.
You don’t feel afraid of water? asked Lise.
Not at all, I can go quite well, said Alyosha.
Mamma, take him away quickly.
I want to sleep, I didn’t sleep all night.
I don’t know what I’ve done....
Lise, you are crazy.
Let us go, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she is too capricious to‐day.
I am afraid to cross her.
And I kiss you too, Lise.
It’s the most fantastic farce.
Katerina Ivanovna was greatly excited, though she looked resolute.
Alyosha could not help believing that of Ivan.
And yet it was impossible not to think about it.
He was incapable of passive love.
It was lacerating, as was said just now.
Don’t go away, she added, addressing Madame Hohlakov.
You did not see it, Ivan Fyodorovitch, he did.
What he thought of me yesterday I don’t know.
(as she said that, she flushed and her eyes shone).
I must tell you that I can’t get over it.
Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch.
I don’t even know whether I still love _him_.
Her voice quivered, and tears glittered on her eyelashes.
Alyosha shuddered inwardly.
That’s true, that’s true, cried Madame Hohlakov.
It will be so all my life.
He knows it.
But it may all be put in two words.
I will gain my point.
Ivan Fyodorovitch fully approves me.
She was breathless.
She felt this herself.
But that’s only for the moment.
Alexey Fyodorovitch, you speak.
Alyosha got up from the sofa.
It’s nothing, nothing! she went on through her tears.
I’m upset, I didn’t sleep last night.
She underwent an instantaneous transformation, which amazed Alyosha.
Such a friend as you are could not suppose that.
I am only too unhappy at losing you.
You will know how to do that.
Of course, no one can take your place....
There was a sarcastic, angry note in her voice.
What I said, I repeat.
I must have his opinion.
But what’s the matter? I couldn’t have believed it.
I can’t understand it! Alyosha cried suddenly in distress.
What are you talking about? I don’t understand.
I don’t understand myself....
I seemed to see in a flash ...
and never have, from the beginning....
And Dmitri, too, has never loved you ...
and only esteems you....
for nobody here will tell the truth.
Alyosha broke off and was silent.
Ivan suddenly laughed and got up.
His hat was in his hand.
And it all comes from your pride.
I am too young and I’ve loved you too much.
It is for ever.
I don’t want to sit beside a ‘laceration.’...
But I don’t know how to speak now.
I’ve said everything....
Good‐by! I don’t want your hand.
Alyosha clasped his hands.
Ivan! he cried desperately after him.
I began it! Ivan spoke angrily, wrongly.
Unjustly and angrily.
Katerina Ivanovna went suddenly into the next room.
You have done no harm.
She had two hundred‐rouble notes in her hand.
and in his passions! I can’t describe it even....
I can’t find my words.
His name is Snegiryov.
He did something wrong in the army and was discharged.
I can’t tell you what.
I thought if you ...
that is I thought ...
I don’t know.
I am so confused.
He will be sure to take it....
I mean, persuade him to take it....
But you know....
now I am rather ...
In the hall she stopped him again as before.
Never trust a woman’s tears, Alexey Fyodorovitch.
I am never for the women in such cases.
I am always on the side of the men.
No, it was all my fault.
I am ready to say so a thousand times over.
What will happen now? To whom, to whom? cried Lise.
Mamma, you really want to be the death of me.
I ask you and you don’t answer.
At the moment the maid ran in.
Katerina Ivanovna is ill....
She is crying, struggling ...
I’ll come and tell you everything you ought to know.
Oh, mercy on us! I am coming, I am coming....
That’s just as it ought to be.
Run and say, Yulia, that I’ll fly to her.
But he won’t go away.
It’s I am screaming.
He will come back to you at once.
Madame Hohlakov at last ran off.
On no account, cried Lise.
On no account now.
Speak through the door.
The trouble is I shall certainly have caused more unhappiness....
At that thought he was completely comforted.
It made him feel stronger.
Dmitri was not at home.
He hasn’t slept here for the last three nights.
Alyosha saw that he was answering in accordance with instructions.
At last he found the house in Lake Street.
Both seemed to be deaf.
I’d better knock first, and he knocked.
Then Alyosha opened the door and crossed the threshold.
He found himself in a regular peasant’s room.
On the left was a large Russian stove.
On the other there was only one very small pillow.
She looked disdainfully at Alyosha as he came in.
Beside the other bed was sitting another female figure.
Her crutches stood in the corner close by.
He was spare, small and weakly built.
It’s a monk come to beg for the monastery.
It was the first time he had seen him.
There was something angular, flurried and irritable about him.
I am Alexey Karamazov, Alyosha began in reply.
That’s very true, smiled Alyosha.
About what business? the captain interrupted impatiently.
His lips were strangely compressed like a thread.
What wisp of tow? muttered Alyosha.
I bit his finger just now.
Was it your finger he bit? Yes.
He was throwing stones with other schoolboys.
There were six of them against him alone.
I asked him what I had done to him.
I don’t want him to be thrashed.
Besides, he seems to be ill.
He was in a sort of frenzy.
Now I understand it, he repeated thoughtfully.
You’ve pierced me to the heart, sir.
Ah, that’s perfectly true! exclaimed Alyosha.
That’s her character, he said, addressing Alyosha again.
She is of humble origin.
Arina Petrovna, compose your countenance.
This is Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov.
Get up, Alexey Fyodorovitch.
You must stand up to be introduced to a lady.
It’s not the Karamazov, mamma, who ...
etcetera, but his brother, radiant with modest virtues.
And he kissed his wife’s hand respectfully and even tenderly.
Good morning! Sit down, Mr.
Tchernomazov, she said.
Karamazov, mamma, Karamazov.
We are of humble origin, he whispered again.
We are of humble origin, the captain muttered again.
Buffoon! blurted out the girl at the window.
Yesterday he brought me an apple.
The captain rushed up to her.
Mamma, mamma, my dear, give over! You are not lonely.
Every one loves you, every one adores you.
Alyosha fancied that he too had tears in his eyes.
I see and hear, muttered Alyosha.
We will go out.
She is a heavenly angel incarnate ...
who has flown down to us mortals,...
if you can understand.
Come along, Alexey Fyodorovitch, we must make an end.
Let us walk slowly, sir.
I should be glad of your kind interest.
To be sure you must have business with me.
My tow was thicker a week ago—I mean my beard.
You should have said so.
Judge for yourself.
I won’t speak of Ilusha, he is only nine.
It’s silly talk and nothing else.
Yes, very much, and he was in a great fury.
They might kill him.
They are children and stupid.
A stone may be thrown and break somebody’s head.
That’s just what has happened.
He has been bruised by a stone to‐day.
And you know he attacks them first.
He is bitter against them on your account.
I’ve heard about that too, it’s dangerous.
and his anger is passed.
Anger! the captain repeated, that’s just what it is.
He is a little creature, but it’s a mighty anger.
You don’t know all, sir.
Let me tell you more.
Their teasing has stirred up a gallant spirit in Ilusha.
For his father and for truth and justice.
The best men amongst us are the greatest drunkards.
‘What is it?’ I asked.
He wouldn’t answer.
Varvara had begun snarling.
A beautiful and lonely spot, sir.
Ilusha and I walked along hand in hand as usual.
‘Father,’ said he, ‘father!’ ‘Well?’ said I.
I saw his eyes flashing.
And I told briefly what I’ve just told you.
‘Father,’ he said, ‘anyway don’t forgive it.
We went for another walk.
For of course a Russian boy is born among horses.
We chattered a long while.
We walked along, both of us depressed.
Ah, I thought, it’s a bad job; there’s something fresh.
We had reached the stone where we are now.
I sat down on the stone.
There were as many as thirty in sight.
Of course, it’s just the season for the kites.
He looked away and turned sideways to me.
And then a gust of wind blew up the sand.
We sat shaking in each other’s arms.
You must thank your brother, Alexey Fyodorovitch.
No, sir, I won’t thrash my boy for your satisfaction.
If you could arrange it— Certainly, sir, muttered the captain.
But now listen to something quite different! Alyosha went on.
I have a message for you.
You have both been insulted by the same man.
You have a generous heart ...
He started, but at first only from astonishment.
The captain flushed red.
Listen, my dear, listen.
We wait on her, but she doesn’t like it.
I have an old friend, a lawyer in K.
But glancing at him he stopped short.
It was uncanny.
What is it? asked Alyosha, startled.
Alexey Fyodorovitch ...
you, sir ...
What trick? A pretty trick, whispered the captain.
He still stared at Alyosha.
Do you see? he shrieked again, pointing to them.
Alyosha looked after him, inexpressibly grieved.
He did not turn back.
Alyosha knew he would not.
She was flustered; something important had happened.
Now she was in a fever.
They were all sitting in her room, waiting.
She had not time to listen.
And you know she is laughing at me every minute.
But this time she was in earnest.
Besides, I’ve forgotten it.
_Merci, maman._ Come in, Alexey Fyodorovitch.
Alyosha went in.
Lise looked rather embarrassed, and at once flushed crimson.
and you know, although mamma muddles things ...
she always rushes from one thing to another ...
I cried when I heard.
Lise was extremely touched by his story.
Alyosha described Ilusha with warm feeling.
He’ll take the money to‐morrow.
and it could not have been otherwise in his position....
But he was too genuinely delighted, and that was mortifying.
So he began to hate me at once.
He is one of those awfully sensitive poor people.
That struck him all at once.
I’ve heard that; Father Zossima told me so.
And I feel like that myself, too.
And though it’s so dreadful, it’s all for the best.
In fact, I believe nothing better could have happened.
It’s just then that I’ll appear.
Ah, that’s true! I understand that perfectly now.
I should never have worked it out.
Forgive me, Alyosha, dear....
Isn’t there in all our analysis—I mean your analysis ...
I was thinking of that on the way here.
No, Lise, I have no contempt for him.
Though I am not altogether ready in myself.
It’s different with you.
And yet you are not a bit formal really.
Give me your hand—that’s right.
Ah, Lise, what a good thing! cried Alyosha joyfully.
You know, I was perfectly sure you were in earnest.
Alyosha, too, was greatly overcome.
Alyosha, dear, you are cold and rude.
He is sure I was in earnest.
Alyosha stood still, holding her hand in his.
Suddenly he stooped down and kissed her on her lips.
Oh, what are you doing? cried Lise.
Alyosha was terribly abashed.
Oh, forgive me if I shouldn’t....
Perhaps I’m awfully stupid....
You said I was cold, so I kissed you....
But I see it was stupid.
Lise laughed, and hid her face in her hands.
But she suddenly ceased laughing and became serious, almost stern.
Alyosha, we must put off kissing.
You do, Lise.
If I go into the world, I must marry.
I know that.
_He_ told me to marry, too.
Ah, you don’t know, but I, too, am a Karamazov.
I am so glad you do.
Alyosha, give me your hand.
Oh, you insupportable person, you are incorrigible.
Just before you came this morning, I tried my fortune.
Here it is.
But I am not going to give it to you.
Look at it from here.
Alyosha, she murmured again, look at the door.
I’d better tell you the whole truth.
Do, then; you won’t find out anything, laughed Alyosha.
For you are right and I am not.
You are my conscience now....
I see you love me, since you guessed that.
I’ll tell you later, Lise—afterwards, said Alyosha, confused.
Yes, my brothers too, murmured Alyosha, pondering.
I don’t like your brother Ivan, Alyosha, said Lise suddenly.
And they are destroying others with them.
I only know that I, too, am a Karamazov....
Yes, I did.
And perhaps I don’t even believe in God.
But Alyosha did not answer.
I shall come to you, Lise....
For the future we will be together.
Alyosha kissed her.
Come, now go.
Make haste back to _him_ while he is alive.
I see I’ve kept you cruelly.
I’ll pray to‐day for him and you.
Alexey Fyodorovitch, this is awful.
This is all childish nonsense and ridiculous.
Sensible advice from a sensible young man.
But why? asked Alyosha.
It’s all so far off.
We may have to wait another year and a half.
I heard it all; I almost dropped.
I might as well be in my grave at once.
Tell me, how is Katerina Ivanovna now? I must know.
She still lies in delirium; she has not regained consciousness.
I nearly sent for a doctor to look after him.
He was driven home in my carriage.
I’m her mother.
No, I won’t show it to you.
Even if she sanctioned it, I wouldn’t.
It was getting late, nearly three o’clock.
He did not want to be noticed.
There was no one in the summer‐house.
Alyosha sat down and began to wait.
At last he felt very depressed—depressed by suspense and uncertainty.
The people must be sitting on it now.
It was a lackey’s tenor and a lackey’s song.
I suppose you’ve forgotten to‐day.
Poetry is rubbish! said Smerdyakov curtly.
Oh, no! I am very fond of poetry.
So far as it’s poetry, it’s essential rubbish.
I could have done better than that.
It had reached them from here, thanks to Grigory Vassilyevitch.
I hate all Russia, Marya Kondratyevna.
We should have had quite different institutions.
That’s as one prefers.
I tell you that, though it makes me bashful.
But he said I was a stinking lackey.
He thinks that I might be unruly.
He is mistaken there.
You’d be glad to run away, Marya Kondratyevna.
Then something unexpected happened.
Alyosha suddenly sneezed.
They were silent.
Alyosha got up and walked towards them.
The guitar lay on the garden‐seat.
Smerdyakov got up slowly; Marya Kondratyevna rose too.
But I simply asked whether you do know? Alyosha explained.
I know nothing of his whereabouts and don’t want to.
Smerdyakov turned a deliberate, unmoved glance upon him.
I hope you’ll forgive me, he added, addressing Marya Kondratyevna.
I was in a hurry to find my brother.
Believe me, it’s on business of great importance to him.
He never tells us, lisped Marya Kondratyevna.
‘What news?’ he’ll ask.
Twice already he’s threatened me with death.
With death? Alyosha exclaimed in surprise.
It’s as though there was an understanding between them.
The Metropolis tavern in the market‐place? The very same.
That’s quite likely, cried Alyosha, much excited.
Thank you, Smerdyakov; that’s important.
I’ll go there at once.
Don’t betray me, Smerdyakov called after him.
Don’t be anxious.
What he had heard threw Alyosha into great agitation.
He ran to the tavern.
Come up the steps; I’ll run down to meet you.
A minute later Alyosha was sitting beside his brother.
Ivan was alone dining.
Waiters were continually darting to and fro in it.
Yet Dmitri was not there.
Shall I order you fish, soup or anything.
He had finished dinner and was drinking tea.
And cherry jam? They have it here.
I don’t know whether I was fond of you even.
Were you very anxious to see me, then? Very.
And then to say good‐by.
That’s how it is I’ve kept away from you.
But in the end I have learned to respect you.
The little man stands firm, I thought.
Though I am laughing, I am serious.
You are a riddle to me even now.
What’s that? laughed Ivan.
You won’t be angry? Alyosha laughed too.
It’s first‐rate soup, they know how to make it here.
One loves the first strength of one’s youth.
I understand too well, Ivan.
One longs to love with one’s inside, with one’s stomach.
I have thought so a long time.
Come, let me have tea.
I am so glad of our talk, Ivan.
I see you are feeling inspired.
You are a steadfast person, Alexey.
We shall see each other then in the world.
Ivan began listening anxiously and questioned him.
Ivan frowned and pondered.
Are you frowning on Smerdyakov’s account? asked Alyosha.
Yes, on his account.
But are you really going so soon, brother? Yes.
I finished it.
I am going.
I finished it just now, you were witness.
I had my own business to settle with Katerina Ivanovna.
It’s all too funny.
I sat watching over her ...
Would you believe it? Yes, it’s the literal truth.
Her feeling for Dmitri was simply a self‐ laceration.
Isn’t Madame Hohlakov laying it on? I think not.
I must find out.
Nobody dies of hysterics, though.
They don’t matter.
God gave woman hysterics as a relief.
I won’t go to her at all.
I did that on purpose.
Besides I feel somehow depressed.
Yes, you’ve been depressed a long time, I’ve noticed it.
But perhaps it may be the morning.
Then you know what for.
That’s what we care about.
How nicely you put that in! Alyosha laughed suddenly.
Well, tell me where to begin, give your orders.
The existence of God, eh? Begin where you like.
You declared yesterday at father’s that there was no God.
Alyosha looked searchingly at his brother.
And so I omit all the hypotheses.
There are all sorts of phrases for it.
Let me make it plain.
I won’t accept it.
I am in earnest in what I say.
And so I’ve told you.
Ivan concluded his long tirade with marked and unexpected feeling.
To begin with, for the sake of being Russian.
The stupider one is, the clearer one is.
Intelligence is a knave, but stupidity is honest and straightforward.
Ivan smiled suddenly quite like a little gentle child.
Rebellion I must make you one confession, Ivan began.
I could never understand how one can love one’s neighbors.
I know that myself, Ivan.
He was God.
But we are not gods.
Suppose I, for instance, suffer intensely.
But even then we should not love them.
But enough of that.
I simply wanted to show you my point of view.
Here is another scene that I thought very interesting.
They succeed, the baby laughs.
Brother, what are you driving at? asked Alyosha.
Just as he did God, then? observed Alyosha.
You turn my words against me.
Well, I am glad.
You asked just now what I was driving at.
You know we prefer beating—rods and scourges—that’s our national institution.
Abroad now they scarcely do any beating.
They brought him up to work for them.
He grew up like a little wild beast among them.
He was caught, tried, and condemned to death.
They are not sentimentalists there.
He was converted.
Yes, that’s characteristic.
The case of Richard is interesting because it’s national.
Our historical pastime is the direct satisfaction of inflicting pain.
It’s peculiarly Russian.
But men, too, can be beaten.
I have an exact account of it.
The child screams.
A counsel is engaged.
A father corrects his child.
The public roars with delight that the torturer is acquitted.
But I’ve still better things about children.
I’ve collected a great, great deal about Russian children, Alyosha.
I’ll leave off if you like.
I want to suffer too, muttered Alyosha.
I’ve forgotten the name.
I must look it up.
There were such men then.
The child is brought from the lock‐up.
He shivers, numb with terror, not daring to cry....
‘Make him run,’ commands the general.
‘Run! run!’ shout the dog‐boys.
The boy runs....
Bravo! cried Ivan, delighted.
If even you say so....
I don’t want to understand anything now.
I want to stick to the fact.
I made up my mind long ago not to understand.
Why are you trying me? Alyosha cried, with sudden distress.
I have narrowed my subject on purpose.
I have believed in it.
I want to embrace.
I don’t want more suffering.
From love for humanity I don’t want it.
I would rather be left with the unavenged suffering.
And that I am doing.
That’s rebellion, murmured Alyosha, looking down.
Tell me yourself, I challenge you—answer.
No, I wouldn’t consent, said Alyosha softly.
I was carried away when I made it up.
You will be my first reader—that is listener.
Why should an author forego even one listener? smiled Ivan.
In those days it was done in all simplicity.
in honor of the birth of the dauphin.
She sees the sinners and their punishment.
Her conversation with God is immensely interesting.
It is true there were many miracles in those days.
These heretics began blasphemously denying miracles.
And that certainly was so, I assure you.
I mean, why they recognized Him.
The crowd weeps and kisses the earth under His feet.
Children throw flowers before Him, sing, and cry hosannah.
‘It is He—it is He!’ all repeat.
The dead child lies hidden in flowers.
He blesses the people in silence and passes on.
I don’t quite understand, Ivan.
But that has been our doing.
The statement of those three questions was itself the miracle.
Behold what Thou didst further.
In that Thou wast right.
That is true.
But Thou didst refuse and wouldst not cast Thyself down.
And the wise spirit that tempted Thee would have rejoiced.
He is weak and vile.
So we have done.
I don’t want Thy love, for I love Thee not.
Thou didst Thyself lift up that banner.
And they will have no secrets from us.
Know that I fear Thee not.
But I awakened and would not serve madness.
To‐morrow I shall burn Thee.
_Dixi._’ Ivan stopped.
Now his words came with a rush.
that’s absurd! he cried, flushing.
They don’t even believe in God perhaps.
Your suffering Inquisitor is a mere fantasy.
Seeing all that he turned back and joined—the clever people.
Perhaps nothing but Atheism, that’s all their secret.
Enough of it.
You are perhaps a Mason yourself! broke suddenly from Alyosha.
How does your poem end? he asked, suddenly looking down.
His silence weighed down upon him.
That was all His answer.
The old man shuddered.
His lips moved.
The Prisoner went away.
And you with him, you too? cried Alyosha, mournfully.
Why, it’s all nonsense, Alyosha.
In the Karamazov way, again.
I won’t deny it.
And Mitya’s version isn’t bad.
Alyosha looked at him in silence.
That’s plagiarism, cried Ivan, highly delighted.
You stole that from my poem.
Thank you though.
And it’s enough, do you hear, enough.
I beg that particularly.
I’ll come on purpose.
It’s rather a solemn promise, you see.
Come, go now to your Pater Seraphicus, he is dying.
Good‐by, kiss me once more; that’s right, now go.
Ivan turned suddenly and went his way without looking back.
He waited a little, looking after his brother.
He had never noticed it before.
He almost ran.
Pater Seraphicus—he got that name from somewhere—where from? Alyosha wondered.
Ivan, poor Ivan, and when shall I see you again?...
Here is the hermitage.
Is it loathing for my father’s house? he wondered.
No, it’s not that either.
Better not think, perhaps.
It all dawned upon him suddenly and became clear.
It had first given rise to his aversion.
Later on, there had been trouble in the house.
Get away, miserable idiot.
Why should I go to Tchermashnya? Ivan asked in surprise.
Smerdyakov was silent again.
Substantially nothing—but just by way of conversation.
Another silence followed.
They did not speak for nearly a minute.
So at least it seemed to Ivan.
At last he moved to get up.
Smerdyakov seemed to seize the moment.
I’m in an awful position, Ivan Fyodorovitch.
Ivan Fyodorovitch sat down again.
On the other side it’s no better.
I can’t depend upon them, sir.
Once it went on for three days.
I fell from the garret that time.
I might have died.
That’s just so.
You can’t tell beforehand.
Besides, you fell from the garret then.
I climb up to the garret every day.
I might fall from the garret again to‐morrow.
And, if not, I might fall down the cellar steps.
I have to go into the cellar every day, too.
Ivan took a long look at him.
He’d be ashamed to.
Well, those signals are known to Dmitri Fyodorovitch too, now.
I feel I am going to have a fit.
I have a presentiment.
Fright alone will bring it on.
They’ve just arranged it.
It’s a very strange remedy of hers.
Marfa Ignatyevna knows of a preparation and always keeps it.
It’s a strong thing made from some herb.
They’ll be asleep.
How could I?...
Nonsense! cried Ivan, almost beside himself.
He looks on that three thousand as his own, too.
He said so to me himself.
‘My father still owes me just three thousand,’ he said.
And she’s got plenty of sense.
She wouldn’t marry a beggar like Dmitri Fyodorovitch.
Dmitri Fyodorovitch knows all that very well.
A sort of shudder passed over Ivan’s face.
He suddenly flushed.
Ivan drew his breath with difficulty.
I spoke because I felt sorry for you.
They were both silent.
an awful scoundrel, too.
Ivan rose suddenly from the bench.
Something strange followed.
Ivan stopped again, and again turned quickly to Smerdyakov.
But a change had passed over him, too.
All his familiarity and carelessness had completely disappeared.
From Tchermashnya, too ...
Only Moscow is farther and Tchermashnya is nearer.
muttered Smerdyakov, with a breaking voice.
He moved and walked as though in a nervous frenzy.
Angry about something.
Who can tell? the valet muttered evasively.
Confound him! Let him be angry then.
Bring in the samovar, and get along with you.
He sat up late that night, till two o’clock.
He felt himself that he had lost his bearings.
His head ached and he was giddy.
At moments he hated himself intensely.
And his departure certainly was sudden.
At last his trunk and bag were ready.
Do me a great service, my dear boy.
Go to Tchermashnya on the way.
I’m sorry, I can’t.
I can only just catch it.
But here I ...
it’s not the time for me to go now....
You see, I’ve two pieces of copse land there.
There’s no getting any one about here to buy it.
The Maslovs have it all their own way.
Well, you write to the priest; he’ll make the bargain.
He can’t do it.
He has no eye for business.
That’s the common complaint.
He is a liar.
I shall be no use in such a business.
I have no eye either.
I’ve done business with him a long time.
I’ll snatch the time somehow.
You must excuse me.
Come, you might oblige your father.
I shan’t forget it.
I don’t know whether I shall go.
I don’t know.
I’ll decide on the way.
Nonsense! Decide at once.
And I won’t delay you more than that.
You can go to Venice.
The priest will give you horses back to Volovya station.
The old man was quite delighted.
He wrote the note, and sent for the horses.
A light lunch was brought in, with brandy.
Of Dmitri, for instance, he did not say a word.
Ivan noticed this particularly.
He must be bored with me, he thought.
I shall always be glad to see you.
Well, Christ be with you! Ivan got into the carriage.
Ivan gave them ten roubles each.
You see ...
I am going to Tchermashnya, broke suddenly from Ivan.
He remembered it long after.
The carriage rolled away.
And all of a sudden he felt very happy.
He was silent, and it was pleasant even so.
The air was fresh, pure and cool, the sky bright.
There’s plenty of time for them, he thought.
He told them to harness the horses.
I won’t go to Tchermashnya.
Shall we get the carriage out? At once.
Mitri here will.
Can you? Of course I can.
I’ve known Fyodor Pavlovitch a long time.
You may depend on it he won’t.
Mitya laughed too.
Thank you, sir.
I’ll be sure to do it.
He was thinking all the night.
I am a scoundrel, he whispered to himself.
They asked the neighbors to help and managed it somehow.
Fyodor Pavlovitch himself was present at the whole ceremony.
He helped, evidently alarmed and upset.
He was in terrible excitement and suspense.
He had to be on the alert.
I knew you would come.
Let me look at you.
I have seen one of my brothers, answered Alyosha.
I mean the elder one, to whom I bowed down.
Perhaps you may still have time to prevent something terrible.
He was suddenly silent and seemed to be pondering.
The words were strange.
What is this suffering in store for him? Don’t inquire.
I seemed to see something terrible yesterday ...
as though his whole future were expressed in his eyes.
But everything and all our fates are from the Lord.
Well, that is your character.
Now I will tell you.
But of that later.
We had four servants, all serfs.
Three days passed and Holy Week had come.
And on Tuesday morning my brother began going to church.
My mother wept with joy and grief.
A marvelous change passed over him, his spirit seemed transformed.
So we are praying to the same God.
Friends came to see us.
Mother shook her head as she listened.
My darling, it’s your illness makes you talk like that.
Mother positively smiled at that, smiled through her tears.
Months and years! he would exclaim.
The disease is affecting his brain.
He beckoned me, and I went up to him.
I went out then and ran to play.
He died the third week after Easter.
So indeed it happened.
For she too died three years afterwards.
And the devil laughed at God’s words.
And he does not work the whole year round.
I saw the dear lad’s heart was moved.
I saw he understood.
And he slept beside me a light and sinless sleep.
where our regiment was stationed at the time.
They were well‐to‐do people of influence and position.
They always gave me a cordial and friendly reception.
I was filled with sudden irrepressible fury.
What’s the meaning of it? I thought.
Wait here a minute, I said to him.
I’ll be back directly, I have forgotten my purse.
And I ran back alone, to Afanasy’s little room.
Forgive me, I said.
Then he was completely aghast.
Your honor ...
Ready, I cried.
Have you ever seen a conqueror? I asked him.
Here is one before you.
He looked at me.
His shot just grazed my cheek and ear.
That’s the place for you, I cried.
I turned to my adversary.
I am ten times worse than you and more, maybe.
Bravo, I cried, clapping my hands.
I agree with you there too.
That’s what’s so strange, I said.
No, there’s something else in this, something original.
I enjoyed listening and looking at them.
Ah, you monk, they would say.
The room was full of people.
I had not noticed her coming into the room.
He sat down.
Your praise is, perhaps, excessive, I replied.
All that, he said, is exceedingly interesting.
I will come to see you again and again.
He looked at me and smiled.
You preach it and don’t believe it yourself.
It’s a spiritual, psychological process.
What do you mean by isolation? I asked him.
But, until then, we must keep the banner flying.
Besides, my vogue was somewhat over.
But let them wonder, for _soon all will be explained_.
He often complained of headache too.
do you know ...
I murdered some one.
I too turned pale.
What are you saying? I cried.
His crime was a great and terrible one.
He hoped to find it so, and so it was.
And after that the punishment began.
But the very opposite of what he expected happened.
I am giving life, but I have taken life.
He had begun to have awful dreams.
Looking at you, I have made up my mind.
I looked at him.
Looking at you, I reproached myself and envied you.
He said this to me almost sullenly.
I have proofs, great proofs.
I shall show them.
Then I cried and kissed him.
I got up at last, I felt afraid.
Well? He looked at me.
Go! said I, confess.
Everything passes, only the truth remains.
He made my heart ache.
Fourteen years I’ve been in hell.
I want to suffer.
I will take my punishment and begin to live.
Perhaps I shall not do it at all.
I could not sleep at night.
I have just come from my wife, he went on.
His eyes were glittering, his lips were twitching.
And I shan’t be believed, they won’t believe my proofs.
I saw he was beside himself.
Decide my fate! he exclaimed again.
Go and confess, I whispered to him.
My voice failed me, but I whispered it firmly.
John, chapter xii.
He read it.
That’s true, he said, but he smiled bitterly.
It’s easy enough to thrust them upon one.
He read it and simply flung down the book.
He was trembling all over.
An awful text, he said.
There’s no denying you’ve picked out fitting ones.
He rose from the chair.
Well! he said, good‐by, perhaps I shan’t come again ...
we shall meet in heaven.
To‐morrow I will beseech those hands to let me go.
He went away.
I was surprised.
Where have you been? I asked him.
I think, he said, I’ve forgotten something ...
my handkerchief, I think....
He sat down.
I stood over him.
You sit down, too, said he.
I sat down.
Do you hear, remember it! And he went out.
To‐morrow, I thought.
And so it was.
It was the same this time.
This declaration he read aloud to the whole assembly.
I cut myself off from men as a monster.
God has visited me, he said in conclusion.
Yet nothing was destined to come of it, after all.
I betrayed nothing, though people ran to question me.
It’s all your doing, they said.
I could not believe in his insanity.
It is done! he said.
My children will never believe it either.
I see in that God’s mercy to them.
I have done my duty.
The Lord vanquished the devil in my heart.
But let me tell you, you were never nearer death.
A week later he died.
The whole town followed him to the grave.
The chief priest made a speech full of feeling.
That is a great thought.
That star will rise out of the East.
That is the modern doctrine of the world.
In that they see freedom.
Alas, put no faith in such a bond of union.
They live only for mutual envy, for luxury and ostentation.
The monastic way is very different.
The salvation of Russia comes from the people.
We are isolated only if the people are isolated.
Take care of the peasant and guard his heart.
Go on educating him quietly.
The spirit of isolation is coming upon the people too.
Money‐ lenders and devourers of the commune are rising up.
He visits princes, though he is only a peasant corrupted.
It is different with the upper classes.
But their wrath is accursed, for it is cruel.
In my wanderings I met in the town of K.
my old orderly, Afanasy.
It was eight years since I had parted from him.
His room was poor, but bright and clean.
He brought me his children: Bless them, Father.
I will pray for them.
What has became of your fortune? he asked.
I have never seen him again since then.
Of a truth, they have more fantastic dreams than we.
Brothers, have no fear of men’s sin.
Love every leaf, every ray of God’s light.
Love the animals, love the plants, love everything.
He could not pass by a child without emotion.
That’s the nature of the man.
Always decide to use humble love.
Every one can love occasionally, even the wicked can.
It’s all like an ocean, I tell you.
Treasure this ecstasy, however senseless it may seem to men.
My friends, pray to God for gladness.
Be glad as children, as the birds of heaven.
That’s what I think.
Though that sounds absurd, it is true.
Work without ceasing.
The righteous man departs, but his light remains.
Men are always saved after the death of the deliverer.
Know the measure, know the times, study that.
When you are left alone, pray.
Love to throw yourself on the earth and kiss it.
Love all men, love everything.
Seek that rapture and ecstasy.
They talk of hell fire in the material sense.
I don’t go into that mystery and I shun it.
Love can never be an offense to Christ.
For they have cursed themselves, cursing God and life.
But they will not attain to death....
Here Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov’s manuscript ends.
I repeat, it is incomplete and fragmentary.
Biographical details, for instance, cover only Father Zossima’s earliest youth.
The elder’s death came in the end quite unexpectedly.
All rose from their seats and hastened to him.
PART III Book VII.
In his hands was put an ikon of the Saviour.
Father Païssy stood over him for a little.
Why do you weep? Rejoice and weep not.
And so, to return to our story.
For they expected something quite different.
This was how the thing happened.
It was meant for a sign.
This conclusion seemed irresistible.
We have had as many holy fathers as they had.
There they are among the Turks, they have forgotten everything.
All who accompanied Father Ferapont immediately understood his action.
Casting out I cast out, he roared again.
He was wearing his coarse gown girt with a rope.
His feet were bare.
I want to sweep them out with a birch broom.
Nowadays folk destroy the true faith.
He gave medicine to keep off the devils.
And now he has begun to stink himself.
In that we see a great sign from God.
The incident he referred to was this.
And for this he is put to shame....
You speak lightly, Father.
Father Païssy, too, raised his voice.
Father Païssy stood over him, waiting resolutely.
But the excited old fanatic was not completely silenced.
He wouldn’t be an elder ...
he would refuse ...
he wouldn’t serve a cursed innovation ...
All began crossing themselves at once.
Their eyes met.
Have you, too, fallen into temptation? cried Father Païssy.
Quite the contrary.
At this moment it haunted him.
He went up and called him by his name.
You suddenly disappeared.
That is a come‐down from the angels.
It’s long since I’ve been surprised at anything here.
I always took you for an educated man....
Nothing at all, my boy.
but not of anger with Rakitin.
What idiocy is this? Alyosha did not answer.
Come, enough nonsense, now to business.
I think I have.
You need keeping up, to judge by your face.
It makes one sorry to look at you.
And then all this bobbery afterwards.
Give me some.
Come to my place....
Vodka is going too far for you, I suppose ...
or would you like some? Give me some vodka too.
Alyosha got up in silence and followed Rakitin.
But, a long while afterwards, Alyosha remembered this.
This phrase Rakitin finished to himself in a whisper.
Eh, you are a set! Stay! he cried suddenly again.
I don’t care ...
where you like.
There was only one point on which all were agreed.
Grushenka was not even mentioned in his will.
All this became known afterwards.
The sofa was covered with shabby and ragged leather.
She certainly was expecting some one.
The appearance of Rakitin and Alyosha caused a slight excitement.
It’s not he, it’s nothing, only other visitors.
Grushenka was standing by the sofa as though still alarmed.
Ah, it’s you, Rakitin? You quite frightened me.
of course, candles....
Fenya, fetch him a candle....
She seemed displeased.
You frightened me, Rakitin, that’s what it is.
Grushenka turned with a smile to Alyosha.
I am the only person he trusts.
He’d rush in at once if he saw a light.
I am afraid of your brother Mitya to‐day, Alyosha.
Why are you so afraid of Mitya to‐day? inquired Rakitin.
Upon my word! You are highly delighted ...
I’ve never seen you like this before.
Rakitin looked her up and down.
Much you know about balls.
I really can’t take it in even now....
Come, don’t you know why you’re glad? said Rakitin, grinning.
I say, I want you to have something nice.
I am so good‐natured now.
Don’t be angry, Rakitin, I’m kind to‐day.
The promotion has not been given, boomed Rakitin.
What promotion? His elder stinks.
I’ll cheer you up, my pious boy.
That was what instinctively surprised him.
I long for some dissipation.
My officer is coming, Rakitin, my officer is coming.
I am expecting the messenger every minute.
If he knew, there would be murder.
I was a cur, that’s the truth....
But it’s a good thing it happened so.
It was a horrid thing, but a good thing too.
No, it’s a good thing it did end like that.
She smiled again.
But I am still afraid of your being angry.
Alyosha, she is really afraid of a chicken like you.
He is a chicken to you, Rakitin ...
Grushenka caught him up hotly.
This is quite different.
I love Alyosha in a different way.
It’s true, Alyosha, I had sly designs on you before.
For I am a horrid, violent creature.
Here’s the champagne! cried Rakitin.
You’re excited, Agrafena Alexandrovna, and not yourself.
Well, let me have some, anyway.
No, I’d better not, he smiled gently.
And you bragged! cried Rakitin.
You can drink the whole bottle alone, Rakitin.
If Alyosha has some, I will.
How so? His elder died to‐day, Father Zossima, the saint.
So Father Zossima is dead, cried Grushenka.
Good God, I did not know! She crossed herself devoutly.
She had pity on me just now....
Agrafena Alexandrovna, I am speaking of you.
You’ve raised my soul from the depths.
Alyosha’s lips were quivering and he caught his breath.
She has saved you, it seems, laughed Rakitin spitefully.
Grushenka jumped up.
Hush, both of you.
Now I’ll tell you all about it.
And you hush, Rakitin, because you are telling lies.
And don’t let me hear anything more from you, Rakitin.
All this Grushenka said with extreme emotion.
I feel as though I were in a madhouse.
I shall begin to cry, I shall, repeated Grushenka.
An onion? Hang it all, you really are crazy.
Rakitin wondered at their enthusiasm.
It’s only a story, but it’s a nice story.
It’s like this.
‘I’m to be pulled out, not you.
So the angel wept and went away.
Eh, I must confess everything.
What nonsense! What nonsense! cried Rakitin, disconcerted.
And she threw the note to him.
Sit down in that corner and keep quiet.
You don’t like us, so hold your tongue.
Your face haunted my heart.
I’ll get him in my clutches and laugh at him.
I was full of spite and anger.
Alyosha got up and went to Rakitin.
Misha, he said, don’t be angry.
She wounded you, but don’t be angry.
Alyosha said this at the instinctive prompting of his heart.
He felt obliged to speak and he turned to Rakitin.
But Rakitin looked at him ironically and Alyosha stopped short.
She won’t! No, I am not like that.
It’s a lesson to me....
She is more loving than we....
and she shall know....
there may be a treasure in that soul....
Alyosha stopped, because he caught his breath.
Alyosha, come to me, sit down here.
She beckoned to him with a happy smile.
That’s right, sit here.
Yes, I really have forgiven him, Grushenka murmured thoughtfully.
The glass broke with a crash.
A little cruel line came into her smile.
Perhaps my heart is only getting ready to forgive.
I shall struggle with my heart.
Perhaps I only love my resentment, not him ...
You’ll never get a woman like me ...
and he won’t either, perhaps ...
I’ll sit by him, fascinate him and work him up.
Grushenka finished with a malicious laugh.
Rakitin got up.
Grushenka leapt up from her place.
I can’t say, I don’t know.
Grushenka jumped up, seeming greatly alarmed.
A letter, here’s the letter, mistress.
It was only a note, a few lines.
She read it in one instant.
Don’t you remember evil against me either, Rakitin.
Well, she has no thoughts for us now! grumbled Rakitin.
Let’s go, or we may hear that feminine shriek again.
I am sick of all these tears and cries.
Alyosha mechanically let himself be led out.
In the yard stood a covered cart.
The window was shut with a slam.
He was lost in thought and moved mechanically.
Lost his job, they say.
Again Alyosha seemed not to hear.
Rakitin could not control himself.
Well, so you’ve saved the sinner? he laughed spitefully.
But this was the last straw for Rakitin.
A marriage! floated whirling through Alyosha’s mind.
There is happiness for her, too....
She has gone to the feast....
No, she has not taken the knife....
That was only a tragic phrase....
tragic phrases should be forgiven, they must be.
Tragic phrases comfort the heart....
Rakitin has gone off to the back alley.
But the high road ...
What’s being read?...
‘He who loves men loves their gladness, too’ ...
‘There’s no living without joy,’ Mitya says....
Gladness, the gladness of some poor, very poor, people....
Ah, he is reading again....
_Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water.
Ah, yes ...
It’s the marriage, the wedding ...
yes, of course.
Who is getting up there from the great table? What!...
He here, too? But he’s in the coffin ...
but he’s here, too.
His face was uncovered, his eyes were shining.
He, too, at the marriage of Cana in Galilee....
It was his voice, the voice of Father Zossima.
We are rejoicing, the little, thin old man went on.
Begin your work, dear one, begin it, gentle one!...
I dare not look, whispered Alyosha.
Do not fear Him.
There they are bringing new wine.
Do you see they are bringing the vessels....
But Alyosha did not listen to the reading.
His shoulder brushed against Father Païssy without his noticing it.
The fresh, motionless, still night enfolded the earth.
He did not know why he embraced it.
He partly knew, too, what the letter contained.
It would be hard to say why this was.
The letter was very indefinite, high‐flown, and full of sentimentality.
He thirsted for that reformation and renewal.
There was another possibility, a different and awful ending.
Suddenly she might say to him: Go away.
I have just come to terms with Fyodor Pavlovitch.
But Mitya did not know what would happen then.
Up to the last hour he didn’t know.
That must be said to his credit.
He had no definite intentions, had planned no crime.
He drove away any other idea, in fact.
But meanwhile he went on struggling....
He was morose and taciturn even with this old woman.
But Mitya persisted and sent his name up again.
The old man again refused to see him.
All the family trembled before the father.
It may be assumed that he felt considerable curiosity.
Mitya was greatly impressed, too, with Samsonov’s immensely swollen face.
Mitya started, leapt up, but sat down again.
seeing the whole town is gossiping about it ...
for here every one’s gossiping of what they shouldn’t ...
and besides, it might have reached you through Grushenka ...
I beg your pardon, through Agrafena Alexandrovna ...
So Mitya began, and broke down at the first sentence.
he knows you, too ...
spoke of you in the highest terms ...
Mitya broke down again.
But these breaks did not deter him.
You see, you cannot, in any case, lose over it.
On my honor, my honor, I swear that.
Above all, he wanted this concluded that very day.
in fact, I’m ready to do anything....
I’ll hand over all the deeds ...
whatever you want, sign anything ...
and we could draw up the agreement at once ...
would save me, in fact ...
for a good, I might say an honorable action....
So you must choose.
It’s either I or the monster.
I see from your venerable eyes that you understand ...
and if you don’t understand, I’m done for ...
The idea suddenly dawned on his despairing mind.
Mitya suddenly felt his legs growing weak under him.
Mitya remained standing, staring motionless.
He suddenly noticed a movement in the old man’s face.
There’s the court, and the lawyers—it’s a perfect misery.
He doesn’t live here, and he’s not here just now.
He is a peasant, he does business in timber.
His name is Lyagavy.
Fyodor Pavlovitch means to go and see him himself.
He’s the very man, it would just suit him.
How can I thank you, Kuzma Kuzmitch? cried Mitya effusively.
Don’t mention it, said Samsonov, inclining his head.
But you don’t know, you’ve saved me.
Oh, it was a true presentiment brought me to you....
So now to this priest! No need of thanks.
I’ll make haste and fly there.
I’m afraid I’ve overtaxed your strength.
I shall never forget it.
It’s because he’s tired, he thought.
He was trembling with delight.
then success was assured.
He would fly off immediately.
Or—the old man was laughing at him.
Alas! The second alternative was the correct one.
The Jew gave him six roubles for it.
And I didn’t expect that, cried Mitya, ecstatically.
to draw up the deed.
He was a very cautious man, though not old.
The priest listened attentively, but gave little advice.
He turned off Mitya’s questions with: I don’t know.
Ah, I can’t say.
How can I tell? and so on.
But Mitya had no time to pause over such trifles.
This annoyed him, but he controlled himself.
They went into the hut.
They went into that room and lighted a tallow candle.
The hut was extremely overheated.
Mitya stood in perplexity.
Of course I must wake him.
My business is too important.
I’ve come in such haste.
He’s drunk, Mitya decided.
He’s been drinking the whole day, the forester chimed in.
Good heavens! cried Mitya.
The priest said nothing, the sleepy forester looked gloomy.
The perspiration was streaming down his face.
With a gesture of despair Mitya agreed.
As soon as he wakes I’ll begin.
Where will you sleep? No, I’m going home.
And now I’ll say good‐by.
I wish you all success.
So it was settled.
Profound dejection clung about his soul like a heavy mist.
He leapt up from the bench.
It’s a tragedy! he said, grinding his teeth.
Stupid! Stupid! cried Mitya.
And how dishonorable it all is! something made him add.
His head began to ache horribly.
No, wait till to‐morrow now.
I’ll stay on purpose.
He seemed to have slept for two hours or more.
And the drunken peasant still lay snoring.
The candle guttered and was about to go out.
But he’s dead, he’s dead! and ...
what am I to do then? cried Mitya frantically.
Mitya brought a pail of water from the passage.
He went back to sleep, leaving Mitya a lighted lantern.
It was dreadfully late when he waked.
It was somewhere about nine o’clock.
He rushed up to him.
Excuse me, you see ...
That’s a lie! said the peasant, calmly and confidently.
You’re bargaining with him for the copse, for the copse.
Do wake up, and collect yourself.
Father Pavel of Ilyinskoe brought me here.
You’re l‐lying! Lyagavy blurted out again.
Mitya’s legs went cold.
For mercy’s sake! It isn’t a joke! You’re drunk, perhaps.
Yet you can speak and understand ...
or else ...
After some discussion Mitya got into the trap.
Three hours later they arrived.
After eating, his spirits and his heart grew lighter.
I’ll settle it to‐ day.
The rest we know already.
Mitya, too, was delighted at this arrangement.
After leaving Grushenka at the gate he rushed home.
Jealousy! Othello was not jealous, he was trustful, observed Pushkin.
But Othello did not begin hiding, spying, peeping.
He was trustful, on the contrary.
The truly jealous man is not like that.
It is not so with the really jealous man.
Of course the reconciliation is only for an hour.
But that the jealous will never understand.
And yet among them are men of noble hearts.
And so jealousy surged up in him again.
He had, in any case, to make haste.
The nine roubles had almost all gone on his expedition.
They parted friends.
But I am anticipating.
No one had been there.
Mitya grew thoughtful.
This was what he decided.
Alas! he had built his hopes on her.
He had resolved to borrow three thousand from that lady.
Mitya’s manners she detested.
Besides, she’s so rich, Mitya argued.
It was half‐past seven when he rang at the bell.
At first fortune seemed to smile upon him.
Yet, I did expect you.
for me alone ...
The realism of actual life, madam, that’s what it is.
But allow me to explain— Realism indeed, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.
I’m all for realism now.
I’ve seen too much of miracles.
Mitya was a little surprised.
The image of Alyosha rose to his mind.
and what I am hoping of you....
I have come, madam— Don’t explain it.
It’s of secondary importance.
You have most likely heard of my cousin, Madame Belmesov.
I simply implore you, madam, to listen to me.
Besides, I am short of time.
I have come in despair ...
Mitya started from his seat again.
Infinitely? But I don’t need so much.
I will save you as I did Belmesov.
But I have thought of them for you.
Thought of them over and over again.
I have been watching you for the last month.
From my gait, madam? said Mitya, smiling.
Yes, from your gait.
I’m all for science and realism now.
‘Enough!’ as Turgenev says.
You will help the poor, and they will bless you.
This is the age of railways, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.
I shall perhaps set off ...
to the gold‐mines....
I’ll come and see you again about it ...
many times, indeed ...
but now, that three thousand you so generously ...
I will go, madam, afterwards....
I’ll go where you like ...
but now— Wait! cried Madame Hohlakov.
without any papers or formalities ...
Madam, I am so touched.
I don’t know how to thank you, indeed ...
for such kindness, but ...
If only you knew how precious time is to me....
though, of course, you’ve known it a long time ...
that I love somebody here....
I have been false to Katya ...
Katerina Ivanovna I should say....
Leave everything, especially women.
Madam, that’s not the point, not at all....
Mitya clasped his hands in entreaty.
Mitya was stupefied.
Why, you said just now ...
you said ...
In that case you misunderstood me.
I was talking of the gold‐mines.
But the money? The three thousand? Mitya exclaimed, awkwardly.
Oh, if you meant money, I haven’t any.
I haven’t a penny, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.
No, no, I’ve no money.
In the first place I never lend money.
Lending money means losing friends.
And I wouldn’t give it to you particularly.
I don’t know you in the dark.
You live at Kuzma Kuzmitch’s.
But I don’t know you now.
I saw her to the house some time ago.
She has been there, sir.
She stayed a little while, and went off again.
What? Went away? cried Mitya.
When did she go? Why, as soon as she came.
She only stayed a minute.
You’re lying, damn you! roared Mitya.
Aie! Aie! shrieked the old woman, but Mitya had vanished.
Fenya uttered a piercing shriek on seeing him.
Dmitri Fyodorovitch, my dear, I don’t know.
You may kill me but I can’t tell you.
Fenya swore and protested.
By God I swear she didn’t come back.
You’re lying! shouted Mitya.
From your terror I know where she is.
He rushed away.
The whole intrigue, the whole deceit was evident.
It all rushed whirling through his mind.
He did not run to Marya Kondratyevna’s.
There was no need to go there ...
not the slightest need ...
he must raise no alarm ...
they would run and tell directly....
Yes, the old man’s bedroom is lighted up.
It took him five minutes to reach the lighted window.
At last he reached the bushes and hid behind them.
He held his breath.
if only I don’t cough or sneeze.
He waited two minutes.
No, this throbbing at my heart won’t stop, he thought.
I can’t wait any longer.
He was standing behind a bush in the shadow.
All Fyodor Pavlovitch’s bedroom lay open before him.
He has got himself up, thought Mitya.
He’s alone, thought Mitya, in all probability he’s alone.
Mitya instantly slipped away into the shadow.
She may be there behind the screen.
Fyodor Pavlovitch moved away from the window.
Mitya watched him eagerly.
He’s alone, he’s alone! he repeated again.
If she were here, his face would be different.
Mitya slipped away into the shadow.
Come here, I’ve a little present for you.
Come, I’ll show you....
He means the three thousand, thought Mitya.
Mitya looked at him from the side without stirring.
Perhaps I shall not kill him, perhaps I shall.
I feel a personal repulsion.
This personal repulsion was growing unendurable.
God was watching over me then, Mitya himself said afterwards.
Then he deliberated again, got up and dressed hurriedly.
Marfa Ignatyevna did not stir.
Yes, the gate stood wide open.
Mechanically he stepped into the garden.
No one was looking out of it then.
Yes, his foreboding had not deceived him.
He recognized him, it was he, the monster, the parricide.
For some seconds he examined the prostrate figure before him.
The old man’s head was covered with blood.
Mitya put out his hand and began feeling it.
But the handkerchief was instantly soaked with blood.
If I’ve killed him, I’ve killed him....
He flew back again to the widow Morozov’s house.
Mitya, running up to the gate, knocked.
Where is she then, Prohor? asked Mitya, stopping short.
What for? cried Mitya.
That I can’t say.
To see some officer.
Mitya left him, and ran like a madman to Fenya.
Relying on Nazar Ivanovitch, they had not locked themselves in.
Both the women squealed.
Aie! I’ll tell you.
What officer? roared Mitya.
She seemed to have grown rigid in that position.
Her wide‐opened, scared eyes were fixed immovably upon him.
Fenya was on the verge of hysterics.
He sat, not reflecting but, as it were, terror‐stricken, benumbed.
They’re all over blood! Yes, answered Mitya mechanically.
He sank into silence again.
Twenty minutes had passed since he had run in.
He suddenly stood up, smiling dreamily.
Mitya looked at his hands again.
You don’t understand what fence, Fenya, and, never mind....
You’ll hear to‐morrow and understand ...
and now, good‐by.
I won’t stand in her way.
I’ll step aside, I know how to step aside.
Live, my joy....
Mitya caught him coming out.
And thanks very much.
I’m in a hurry, Pyotr Ilyitch, please make haste.
Seeing his blood‐stained face, Mitya started and scowled wrathfully.
Mitya threw it angrily on the floor.
Oh, damn it! he said.
Haven’t you a rag of some sort ...
Here’s a wash‐stand.
I’ll pour you out some water.
A wash‐stand? That’s all right ...
In your pocket, or on the table here.
They won’t be lost.
In my pocket? Yes, in my pocket.
Look here, let’s first settle that business of the pistols.
Give them back to me.
Here’s your money ...
because I am in great need of them ...
and I haven’t a minute, a minute to spare.
But I shan’t have change enough.
How have you grown so rich? the latter asked.
Here, Misha! he called into the passage.
let it be just the same again.
He’ll muddle it.
Champagne’s the chief thing, let them bring up champagne.
They know what I had then.
But listen! Pyotr Ilyitch interrupted with some impatience.
Give him your note.
Well, now come and wash, said Pyotr Ilyitch sternly.
That’s right, come along.
But take off your coat.
it’s not the coat.
It’s only a little here on the sleeve....
And that’s only here where the handkerchief lay.
It must have soaked through.
Pyotr Ilyitch listened, frowning.
They began to wash.
Pyotr Ilyitch held the jug and poured out the water.
Look, you haven’t got your nails clean.
Then change your shirt.
I haven’t time.
You see I’ll ...
I’ll turn it up at the wrist.
It won’t be seen under the coat....
Whom have you been beating now ...
or killing, perhaps? Nonsense! said Mitya.
Why ‘nonsense’? Don’t worry, said Mitya, and he suddenly laughed.
I smashed an old woman in the market‐place just now.
Confound it! An old woman, an old man....
Have you killed some one? We made it up.
We had a row—and made it up.
In a place I know of.
We parted friends.
He’s forgiven me....
He’s sure to have forgiven me by now ...
Just as you did with that captain over some nonsense....
Upon my honor I’ve no time now.
And there’s no need, it’s too late for talking.
You put it on the table ...
Here it is.
Here are your pistols.
Two or three I should say.
You’ll lose it like that.
Try and find out.
I don’t know on what terms you are ...
Where are you really off to now, eh? To Mokroe.
Damn thousands! I’m talking of the female character.
That’s what he says.
Oh, a fancy.
But that’s foolishness, a moment’s foolishness.
Here’s some paper.
No, a clean new piece, writing‐paper.
Now, let’s go.
Where are we going? No, wait a minute....
I was fooling about the bullet! I want to live.
I love life! You may be sure of that.
I love golden‐haired Phœbus and his warm light....
Upon my word.
That’s enough for you.
You shut up.
Listen, though you’re such a savage I’ve always liked you....
I feel anxious.
Thanks, old fellow.
I’m a savage you say.
Savages, savages! That’s what I am always saying.
Savages! Why, here’s Misha! I was forgetting him.
Don’t dare to do such a thing! cried Pyotr Ilyitch.
Put your money away.
I haven’t time for that.
Let’s drink at the Plotnikovs’, in the back room.
Shall I ask you a riddle? Ask away.
There were three shop‐assistants and two errand boys always employed.
They were awaiting Mitya with impatience in the shop.
Pyotr Ilyitch was astounded.
There’s no time to lose.
I got Timofey ready to start.
I know how he’ll go.
Their pace won’t be ours, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.
I warrant the time, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.
He began a sentence and forgot the end of it.
Pyotr Ilyitch found himself obliged to come to the rescue.
Four dozen champagne, not a bottle less.
The fondants are all right.
But he only succeeded in saving a hundred roubles.
This way, my economist, this way, don’t be angry.
They’ll give us a bottle here directly.
We’ll taste it.
First‐class oysters, the last lot in.
Hang the oysters.
I don’t eat them.
And we don’t need anything, cried Pyotr Ilyitch, almost angrily.
There’s no time for oysters, said Mitya.
And I’m not hungry.
I’m talking of a higher order.
There’s no order in me, no higher order.
that’s all over.
There’s no need to grieve about it.
I made it myself ...
not while I was pulling the captain’s beard, though....
That’s the long and short of it.
You know, I keep thinking of your pistols.
That’s all foolery, too! Drink, and don’t be fanciful.
I love life.
I’ve loved life too much, shamefully much.
I bless the creation.
Let us drink to life, dear brother.
They drank a glass each.
He’ll remember it afterwards, Mitya remarked.
Pyotr Ilyitch listened in silence.
Mitya, too, was silent for a while.
It belongs to Varvara Alexyevna, the mistress, answered the clerk.
She brought it and forgot it here.
It must be taken back to her.
I saw one like it ...
in the regiment ...
From somebody’s pocket, you know.
You go to the devil.
I’m talking of other people’s money.
Well, and what happened? Oh, nothing.
And what then? Naturally I was whipped.
What have you stolen? inquired Pyotr Ilyitch curiously.
As he said this, Mitya suddenly got up.
Are you ready? We’ll come! Mitya started.
Good‐by, Pyotr Ilyitch, don’t remember evil against me.
But you’re coming back to‐morrow? Of course.
Oh, yes, the bill.
Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear good Dmitri Fyodorovitch, don’t harm my mistress.
And it was I told you all about it....
That’s why he’s come back from Siberia.
Now, it’s all clear, as clear as daylight.
Fenya, get up, don’t kneel to me.
But it doesn’t matter if you don’t.
It’s all the same now.
Good‐by, Pyotr Ilyitch! My last tear is for you!...
I’ve heard of that officer, Grushenka’s former flame.
Well, if he has turned up....
They’re a set of brawlers, that’s all.
They’ll drink and fight, fight and make friends again.
They are not men who do anything real.
But now he’s not drunk.
‘Drunk in spirit’—they’re fond of fine phrases, the villains.
It’s still lying on my floor....
The game cheered him.
This news roused singular interest in his listeners.
They left off playing.
The story of Madame Hohlakov’s present was received with skepticism.
Hasn’t he robbed his old father?—that’s the question.
Three thousand! There’s something odd about it.
And it was three thousand he talked about ...
Pyotr Ilyitch listened.
Going up to the gate he knocked.
The swift motion revived Mitya.
It is true he had not yet seen him.
But he could not reason at that moment.
His present plan of action had arisen without reasoning.
There was so much behind that tortured him.
But that moment flew by like a spark.
They had been galloping nearly an hour.
It had not occurred to him before.
Mitya frowned as though in pain.
Yes, indeed ...
he was rushing there ...
with such feelings ...
while they were asleep ...
she was asleep, perhaps, there too....
An angry feeling surged up in his heart.
Well, Timofey was saying they’re all gentlefolk.
I didn’t ask particularly.
They’ve set to playing cards, so Timofey said.
It’s most likely not more than eleven.
Quicker, Andrey! Quicker! Mitya cried again, nervously.
Only I’m afraid of angering you, sir.
forgive me, sir, it’s my conscience ...
Are you a driver? he asked frantically.
Then you know that one has to make way.
One can’t run over a man.
One can’t spoil people’s lives.
And if you have spoilt a life—punish yourself....
These phrases burst from Mitya almost hysterically.
Nothing will restrain them, they just force it along.
that’s how we look on you ...
But Mitya did not hear.
He was frantically praying and muttering to himself.
Let me pass by Thy judgment ...
I am a wretch, but I love Thee.
But let me love to the end....
Here and now for just five hours ...
till the first light of Thy day ...
for I love the queen of my soul ...
I love her and I cannot help loving her.
Thou seest my whole heart....
Farewell and forget your victim ...
Drive on, Andrey, I come! Mitya exclaimed, feverishly.
They’re not asleep, Mitya repeated joyously.
He was a widower, with four grown‐up daughters.
She’s here, too ...
With whom? With whom? Some strangers.
They’re dressed like civilians.
They’ve come back from Tcherny, and are putting up here.
One’s quite a young gentleman, a relative of Mr.
Miüsov, he must be, but I’ve forgotten his name ...
He’s traveling with this young relation of Mr.
Is that all? Yes.
Stay, listen, Trifon Borissovitch.
She’s sitting with them.
She’s sitting quite dull.
She’s combing the young gentleman’s hair.
Not him, sir.
It’s the young gentleman that’s Mr.
Miüsov’s relation ...
I’ve forgotten his name.
That’s it, Kalganov! All right.
I’ll see for myself.
They’ve been drinking tea, the official gentleman asked for liqueurs.
The authorities have sent them away.
Send for them.
Certainly send for them! cried Mitya.
Do you remember? You did send it flying.
I may well remember.
You must have left three thousand behind you.
Now, listen and remember.
Open it, and hand champagne immediately.
And the girls, we must have the girls, Marya especially.
Here, Andrey, let’s settle.
for your readiness, for your love....
Remember Karamazov! I’m afraid, sir, faltered Andrey.
Give me five roubles extra, but more I won’t take.
Trifon Borissovitch, bear witness.
Forgive my foolish words ...
What are you afraid of? asked Mitya, scanning him.
Maximov was laughing violently at something.
He caught his breath.
Aie! shrieked Grushenka, the first to notice him.
I’m coming, too.
I’m here till morning.
There are other rooms.
Sit down with us.
How are you? Delighted to see you, dear ...
and precious fellow, I always thought a lot of you.
Good evening, Maximov ventured blandly on the left.
Mitya rushed up to him, too.
where I, too, adored ...
They’ll bring the wine at once....
I brought this with me.
He was almost choking.
If my suverin lady is permitting— he was beginning.
What does ‘suverin’ mean? ‘Sovereign,’ I suppose? interrupted Grushenka.
I can’t help laughing at you, the way you talk.
Me, me frighten you? cried Mitya, flinging up his hands.
Come, come, what a fellow you are! cried Grushenka reproachfully.
I’m not crying....
Well, there you are again....
Come, cheer up, cheer up! Grushenka said to him persuasively.
Every one laughed.
I want some myself, and I can’t bear liqueurs.
And best of all, you’ve come yourself.
We were fearfully dull here....
In confusion he thrust them hurriedly into his pocket.
Kalganov took it from him and poured out the champagne.
His whole countenance suddenly changed.
He seemed to have become suddenly gentle and subdued.
If he stood up he’d be six foot three.
The thought flitted through Mitya’s mind.
Mitya immediately stared at Kalganov and then at Maximov.
Sometimes there was something fixed and obstinate in his expression.
I’m taking him back.
Were you a cavalry officer? put in Kalganov at once.
No, you see, Maximov turned to him.
What I mean is that those pretty Polish ladies ...
when they danced the mazurka with our Uhlans ...
a little white one ...
and the _pan_‐father and _pan_‐mother look on and allow it....
They allow it ...
That’s how it is ...
offers her his hand, he he! Maximov ended, tittering.
The dress of both the Poles looked rather greasy.
You can reckon on that, the tall Pole snapped contemptuously.
The Polish gentleman spoke the truth.
At first he meant to marry her himself.
So you married a lame woman? cried Kalganov.
I thought she was hopping; she kept hopping....
I thought it was for fun.
Yes, so pleased.
But it turned out to be quite a different cause.
Grushenka, too, laughed.
Mitya was at the pinnacle of happiness.
She did run away.
‘You’re an educated man,’ she said to me.
Mitya followed his lead without protest.
Well, but if they did thrash him! he cried, laughing.
The other shrugged his shoulders in reply.
Neither of them had a watch.
Why not talk? Let other people talk.
This time the Pole answered with unmistakable irritability.
_Pani_, I didn’t oppose it.
I didn’t say anything.
All right then.
Come, tell us your story, Grushenka cried to Maximov.
But what were you beaten for? cried Kalganov.
For Piron! answered Maximov.
What Piron? cried Mitya.
The famous French writer, Piron.
They seized me and thrashed me.
But what for? What for? For my education.
Mitya started, and at once left off laughing.
Mitya began to feel anxious.
To Poland, _panovie_, I drink to your Poland! cried Mitya.
Pan Vrublevsky, put in the Pole on the sofa.
To Poland, _panovie!_ cried Mitya, raising his glass.
Hurrah! All three drank.
Mitya seized the bottle and again poured out three glasses.
And I would, too ...
to Russia, the old grandmother! tittered Maximov.
All! All! cried Mitya.
Mitya filled the glasses.
To Russia! Hurrah! he shouted again.
The Poles did not touch theirs.
You’re fools, you _panovie_, broke suddenly from Mitya.
Pan Vrublevsky was specially furious.
Can one help loving one’s own country? he shouted.
Her face glowed, her eyes were shining.
Mitya was terribly alarmed.
_Panovie_, forgive me! It was my fault, I’m sorry.
Vrublevsky, _panie_ Vrublevsky, I’m sorry.
Faro? Splendid! cried Mitya.
That’s true, assented Pan Vrublevsky.
Lite? What do you mean by ‘lite’? asked Grushenka.
It’s always late with them.
They’re dull themselves, so they want others to be dull.
I’m ready, _panie_, added he, addressing Mitya.
I want to lose a lot to you.
Take your cards.
Make the bank.
That’s much the best way, chimed in Pan Vrublevsky.
Cards! Mitya shouted to the landlord.
Give me five roubles, he whispered to Mitya.
And if you lose that, come again, come again.
Very good, Maximov whispered joyfully, and he ran back again.
Mitya, too, returned, apologizing for having kept them waiting.
The Poles had already sat down, and opened the pack.
They looked much more amiable, almost cordial.
He wore an air of solemnity.
To your places, gentlemen, cried Pan Vrublevsky.
How much in the bank? To correspond? asked Mitya.
A million! laughed Mitya.
‘So much the better.’ The banker throws the dice.
‘I didn’t know that,’ says Podvysotsky.
That’s not true, said Kalganov.
_Panie_ Kalganov, in gentlemanly society one doesn’t say such things.
The rouble won, too.
A corner! cried Mitya.
Lost! shouted Mitya.
A ‘double’ on the seven! The seven too was trumped.
Stop! cried Kalganov suddenly.
The rouble stakes kept winning.
On the double! shouted Mitya furiously.
You’ve lost two hundred, _panie_.
That’s enough! he shouted in his ringing voice.
What’s the matter? Mitya stared at him.
That’s enough! I don’t want you to play any more.
Don’t! Why? Because I don’t.
Hang it, come away.
I won’t let you go on playing.
Mitya gazed at him in astonishment.
Give it up, Mitya.
He may be right.
How dare you! Pan Vrublevsky, too, growled at Kalganov.
Don’t dare to shout like that, cried Grushenka.
Most illustrious, two words with you.
You’ll be glad to hear it.
The bodyguard? Let him come, and I want him, too.
I must have him! cried Mitya.
March, _panovie_! Where are you going? asked Grushenka, anxiously.
We’ll be back in one moment, answered Mitya.
The Poles looked severe but were evidently inquisitive.
Well, look here, _panie_, I won’t keep you long.
There’s money for you, he pulled out his notes.
The Pole gazed open‐eyed at Mitya, with a searching look.
Three thousand, _panie_? He exchanged glances with Vrublevsky.
You understand that, _panie_, for ever.
Here’s the door, you go out of it.
He had no doubts.
An expression of extraordinary resolution passed over the Pole’s face.
The Poles exchanged glances again.
The short man’s face looked more forbidding.
Besides, I haven’t the three thousand with me.
Upon my word, the money’s there, hidden.
What next? he asked ironically.
For shame! and he spat on the floor.
Pan Vrublevsky spat too.
And so indeed he did.
_Pani_ Agrippina, I have received a mortal insult! he exclaimed.
You can’t have forgotten it in five years.
She was red with passion.
Just so, _pani_, I’m not pusillanimous, I’m magnanimous.
But I was astounded when I saw your lovers.
I spat in the _pan’s_ face.
What? He offered you money for me? cried Grushenka, hysterically.
How dare you defend me to him? shrieked Grushenka.
I’m—a knight, I’m—a nobleman, and not a _lajdak_.
He used to laugh and sing to me....
A regular Sodom! Vrublevsky roared suddenly.
Animal! bellowed Pan Vrublevsky.
It’s as good as stolen from you.
I don’t want my fifty roubles back, Kalganov declared suddenly.
If not, good‐by.
Mitya slammed the door after him.
Lock it, said Kalganov.
That’s capital! exclaimed Grushenka relentlessly.
Grushenka was the first to call for wine.
I want to drink.
I want to be quite drunk, as we were before.
But Grushenka was continually sending him away from her.
Go and enjoy yourself.
She was tremendously excited.
And Mitya hastened to obey her.
The chorus were in the next room.
In the four rooms for visitors there were beds.
Grushenka settled herself just at the door.
Mitya set an easy chair for her.
Mitya bustled about.
Only the girls were very eager for the champagne.
The men preferred rum, brandy, and, above all, hot punch.
They’re a lousy lot, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, he said.
Maximov, blissfully drunk, never left his side.
Grushenka, too, was beginning to get drunk.
I was frightened.
But she did not need his answer.
Well, go and enjoy yourself ...
she sent him away once more.
Don’t cry, I’ll call you back again.
He spoke strangely, often frowning, and stopping abruptly.
What are you frowning at? she asked.
I left a man ill there.
To‐morrow I may have something to say to you....
I won’t say it to‐day, but to‐morrow.
Come, go along now, go and amuse yourself.
Why are you sad? I see you’re sad....
No, be merry.
I’m merry; you be merry, too....
I love somebody here.
Guess who it is.
She meant Kalganov.
And the dances were as bad.
He particularly disliked one new song to a jaunty dance‐tune.
Kalvanov was positively indignant.
That’s just a song of yesterday, he said aloud.
And, bending over him tenderly, she kissed his forehead.
Stay with me a minute.
Mitya, run and find his Maximov.
He had drunk two cups of chocolate.
They all went to look on.
Maximov danced his dance.
Don’t you want a drink? I’ll just have a liqueur....
for old people.
He he! No, brother, we’ve none of that special sort.
Oh, all right, all right.
But damn it all, wait a bit!...
Eat and drink and be merry, meanwhile.
Don’t you want money? Later on, perhaps, smiled Maximov.
All right, all right....
Mitya’s head was burning.
The fresh air revived him.
But yet it was easier for him then.
It would never return.
Now he had everything to make life happy ...
I would restore the stolen money.
I’d give it back; I’d get it somehow....
The landlord seemed disconcerted.
What’s the time? It’ll be three o’clock.
Past three, it must be.
We’ll leave off soon.
We’ll leave off.
Don’t mention it; it doesn’t matter.
Keep it up as long as you like....
But she was not there.
Mitya peeped behind the curtain—she was there.
She was sitting in the corner, on a trunk.
Mitya, Mitya, I loved him, you know.
Or so it seemed to a silly girl like me....
And now, O Lord, it’s not the same man.
Even his face is not the same; he’s different altogether.
I shouldn’t have known him.
I couldn’t get a word in.
She must have changed him like that.
Mitya, darling, stay, don’t go away.
Who is that man? That’s what you must tell me.
A falcon flew in, and my heart sank.
You came in and all grew bright.
What’s he afraid of? I wondered.
For you were frightened; you couldn’t speak.
It’s sweet to be a slave.
And I do deserve to suffer.
Stay, wait, afterwards, I won’t have that....
she suddenly thrust him away.
Mitya followed like a drunken man.
I’m drunk now, that’s what it is....
I am drunk! I’m drunk as it is ...
drunk with you ...
and now I’ll be drunk with wine, too.
In another minute she might have cried.
Give him a present, he’s poor, you know.
Ah, the poor, the insulted!...
Do you know, Mitya, I shall go into a nunnery.
But to‐day let us dance.
To‐morrow to the nunnery, but to‐day we’ll dance.
But I want to pray.
I gave a little onion.
Wicked as I’ve been, I want to pray.
Mitya, let them dance, don’t stop them.
Every one in the world is good.
Every one—even the worst of them.
The world’s a nice place.
Though we’re bad the world’s all right.
We’re good and bad, good and bad....
I’m very good....
She got up from her chair, staggering.
Wine doesn’t give peace.
Everything’s going round, the stove, and everything.
I want to dance.
Let every one see how I dance ...
let them see how beautifully I dance....
She really meant it.
to look on.
Call them in, too, that were locked in....
Let them look on, too....
Hi, you ...
Podvysotskys! Come, she’s going to dance.
She calls you.
_Lajdak!_ one of the Poles shouted in reply.
Leave off laughing at Poland, said Kalganov sententiously.
He too was drunk.
One _lajdak_ doesn’t make a Poland.
Be quiet, my pretty boy, eat a sweetmeat.
Ach, what fellows! As though they were not men.
she said in an exhausted voice.
I’m weak, I can’t....
The lady’s been drinking.
The pretty lady has been drinking, voices were heard saying.
Mitya, lead me away ...
take me, said Grushenka helplessly.
Don’t touch me....
she faltered, in an imploring voice.
Don’t touch me, till I’m yours....
I’ve told you I’m yours, but don’t touch me ...
With them here, with them close, you mustn’t.
It’s nasty here....
I’ll obey you! I won’t think of it ...
I worship you! muttered Mitya.
Yes, it’s nasty here, it’s abominable.
It must be honorable ...
it shall be honorable for the future ...
I’ll take you and we’ll fly away....
Nothing, muttered Mitya, through his teeth.
Grusha, you wanted to be honest, but I’m a thief.
But I’ve stolen money from Katya....
Give it her back, take it from me....
Why make a fuss? Now everything of mine is yours.
What does money matter? We shall waste it anyway....
Folks like us are bound to waste money.
But we’d better go and work the land.
I want to dig the earth with my own hands.
We must work, do you hear? Alyosha said so.
And if she won’t forgive us, we’ll go, anyway.
Take her her money and love me....
Don’t love her....
Don’t love her any more.
If you love her, I shall strangle her....
I’ll put out both her eyes with a needle....
I love you.
I love only you.
I’ll love you in Siberia....
Why Siberia? Never mind, Siberia, if you like.
I don’t care ...
we’ll work ...
there’s snow in Siberia....
I love driving in the snow ...
and must have bells....
Now it’s stopped.
Mitya let his head sink on her breast.
Grushenka opened her eyes.
What’s the matter? Was I asleep? Yes ...
a bell ...
I was with some one I loved, with you.
And far, far away.
I was cold, and the snow glistened....
It was as though I was not on earth.
How sweet that is!...
Mitya, who is that looking at us? she whispered.
And not one person alone, it seemed.
He jumped up and walked quickly to the intruder.
An instantaneous shiver ran down his back, and he shuddered.
He recognized all those people instantly.
And that small young man in spectacles....
And there at the door Kalganov with Trifon Borissovitch....
It is absolutely imperative that you should give an explanation.
The old man! cried Mitya frantically.
The old man and his blood!...
This is impossible! cried the small young man.
Mihail Makarovitch, Mihail Makarovitch, this won’t do!...
I beg you’ll allow me to speak.
I should never have expected such behavior from you....
He stared at them all with wild eyes.
I ran out to beg him not to kill her.
It would make a scandal.
Pyotr Ilyitch was by no means phlegmatic at that moment.
Ask at the top of the stairs.
If the lady wants to receive you, she’ll receive you.
If she won’t, she won’t.
She went away.
He remained waiting in the entry.
She was surprised on hearing the announcement from the maid.
I plunged headlong, he described it afterwards.
Madame Hohlakov was impressed.
Madame Hohlakov made up her mind to see him.
Kindly leave me at once....
I am a mother....
I have never given him money, never! Oh, run, run!...
Don’t say another word! Save the old man ...
run to his father ...
He ran out in a fury, stamping.
He rushed at me, but I slipped away....
Excuse me, I....
And now it’s happened ...
Have you heard about Father Zossima?...
But I don’t know what I’m saying ...
Of course, he’s the person to go to.
what comes to light ...
how they’ll try him ...
and what he’s condemned to....
in case it’s needed....
To be sure! Madame Hohlakov skipped, delighted, to her bureau.
Here’s the note! she turned quickly to Pyotr Ilyitch.
Go, save him.
She ran out to accompany him to the passage.
How delightful it is that you are living here!...
Such precision! Such practical ability!...
They must appreciate you, they must understand you.
If there’s anything I can do, believe me ...
Her one hope....
Oh, go, go!...
Tastes differ, as we all know.
Though the fare was not _recherché_, it was abundant.
And yet he was himself a landowner.
And that made him seem constantly uneasy.
But I am anticipating.
Yet it was perfectly simple and happened quite naturally.
He was short, and delicate‐looking.
He saw instantly that every one knew.
She could never get accustomed to it.
She jumped up and ran half‐awake to Smerdyakov’s room.
He must be out there, poor dear, she thought.
Grigory was muttering incoherently: He has murdered ...
his father murdered....
Why scream, silly ...
fetch some one....
His light‐colored dressing‐gown and white shirt were soaked with blood.
It was resolved to act with energy.
That’s clear, that’s clear! repeated the prosecutor in great excitement.
I meant to kill him.
But I’m not guilty.
He did it through me.
I tortured him and drove him to it.
But he was quickly and resolutely suppressed.
The prosecutor positively seized hold of him.
This is absolutely irregular, Mihail Makarovitch! he cried.
You are positively hindering the inquiry....
You’re ruining the case....
he almost gasped.
Judge us together! Grushenka cried frantically, still kneeling.
Punish us together.
That will refresh you, that will calm you.
Be calm, don’t be frightened, he added, extremely politely.
I have drunk it, gentlemen, I have ...
I am not guilty.
It’s a terrible accusation, gentlemen, a knock‐down blow.
Alive? He’s alive? cried Mitya, flinging up his hands.
His face beamed.
That’s an answer to my prayer.
I’ve been praying all night.
And he crossed himself three times.
He was almost breathless.
He, too, leapt to his feet.
And so you— the investigating lawyer began.
All this is horribly upsetting, horribly.
Mitya took his hands from his face and laughed.
His eyes were confident.
He seemed completely transformed in a moment.
I’m rather drunk, too, I’ll tell you that frankly.
Oh, of course, there’s a horrible suspicion ...
hanging over me ...
if Grigory has given evidence....
do you see?...
Stay, stay, write this.
That’s a wild idea.
It’s quite a wild idea!...
I will prove you that and you’ll be convinced directly....
You will laugh, gentlemen.
You’ll laugh yourselves at your suspicion!...
many times I wanted to ...
unhappily, unhappily! You wanted to.
I have never concealed my feelings.
Only lately I declared them in Father Zossima’s cell....
since I haven’t concealed my feelings in the past ...
so I won’t make a secret of it now.
We will continue, interposed Nikolay Parfenovitch.
And not only jealousy.
Disputes about money? Yes, about money, too.
I told every one so, shouted it at them.
I was desperately in need of that three thousand ...
I don’t know how to express it.
that is like me alone.
That was a mistake, like me alone, me alone!...
Gentlemen, my head aches ...
His brows contracted with pain.
But now that he’s dead, I feel differently.
You feel penitent? No, not penitent, don’t write that.
That’s what I mean.
Write that down, if you like.
Saying this Mitya became very mournful.
At that moment another unexpected scene followed.
He was seized by the arms.
He struggled, and tried to tear himself away.
It took three or four men to hold him.
The lawyers tried to soothe him.
About ten minutes passed like this.
By all means, Mihail Makarovitch, answered the investigating lawyer.
In the present case we have nothing against it.
In fact, I talked to her and she understood.
Mitya jumped up and rushed towards him.
Forgive me, gentlemen, oh, allow me, allow me! he cried.
I will, I will be calm, cheerful, in fact.
We’ll finish this off directly, finish it off gayly.
Oh, let me tell you that.
That one thing I’ll tell you now....
I see I’m with honorable men.
But they were happy tears.
He recovered himself instantly.
When the police captain went out, Mitya was positively gay.
I’m at those details again.
I speak in your interests.
And damn the details! So spoke Mitya.
The interrogation began again.
You approve, Ippolit Kirillovitch? He turned to the prosecutor.
Oh, undoubtedly, replied the prosecutor.
His tone was somewhat cold, compared with Nikolay Parfenovitch’s impulsiveness.
He had heard of him in Petersburg.
Excellent! Thank you.
I pledged them, gentlemen.
I pledged them for ten roubles.
What more? That’s all about it.
Didn’t you know? The prosecutor and Nikolay Parfenovitch exchanged glances.
Allow me to interrupt you, the prosecutor put in politely.
Don’t think I’m drunk.
I’m quite sober now.
And, besides, being drunk would be no hindrance.
And I’ve my own dignity to keep up, too.
I quite understand the difference for the moment.
And it’s your business to watch me.
I know the tricks.
I’ve been in the service, too.
Ha ha! Nikolay Parfenovitch listened, and laughed too.
We began, indeed, with questions of the greatest importance.
I don’t withdraw my question, however.
Why I needed it?...
Oh, for one thing and another....
Well, it was to pay a debt.
That’s my principle.
I wanted to pay a debt.
By all means.
Write down that I won’t say, that I won’t.
Write that I should think it dishonorable to say.
That is entirely a matter for your personal decision.
After which I will beg you to continue.
Gentlemen, I’m not angry ...
Mitya muttered in a rather disconcerted tone.
Mitya was impatiently anxious not to omit the slightest detail.
Mitya disliked this, but submitted; got angry, though still good‐humoredly.
Little by little Mitya began to grow surly.
He was heard with silent attention.
They laid particular stress on this, and noted it down.
But he pulled himself together to go on again.
Mitya let them write it without protest.
That, too, was carefully written down.
Oh, yes, he laughed gloomily.
Of course I recognize it.
Let me have a look at it....
Hang it all, I shouldn’t have concealed it from you.
Certainly I will be so good, gentlemen.
And Mitya described how he took the pestle and ran.
I just picked it up and ran off.
Bother the pestle! broke from him suddenly.
But still— Oh, to keep off dogs....
Oh, because it was dark....
In case anything turned up.
at once ...
Fyodor Pavlovitch ...
Well, upon my word, gentlemen! Yes, I took the pestle....
I snatched it up and ran—that’s all.
I listen to you and am haunted by a dream....
It’s a dream I have sometimes, you know....
I often dream it—it’s always the same ...
That’s just what you’re doing now.
Yes, it is.
No; no need to write it down.
But still you do have curious dreams.
began Nikolay Parfenovitch, with extraordinary softness.
He grew more good‐ humored at every word.
but— Be silent, heart, Be patient, humble, hold thy peace.
Well, shall I go on? he broke off gloomily.
If you’ll be so kind, answered Nikolay Parfenovitch.
Mitya could gather nothing from their faces.
They’re angry and offended, he thought.
Well? said the investigating lawyer.
You pulled out the weapon and ...
hit him on the head and cracked his skull....
I suppose that’s your story.
That’s it! His eyes suddenly flashed.
Our story? repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch.
But the devil was conquered.
I rushed from the window and ran to the fence.
I remember that very well.
I ran across the garden to the fence ...
A sort of paroxysm of indignation seized on Mitya’s soul.
What makes you think that? observed Nikolay Parfenovitch.
It was not? It was shut.
And who could open it? Bah! the door.
That is perfectly clear.
There can be no doubt of that circumstance.
Mitya was absolutely dumbfounded.
But that’s utterly impossible! he cried, completely at a loss.
I didn’t go in....
That’s all, that’s all....
I remember to the last minute.
He instantly lost all trace of his reserve and dignity.
He asked the question with a sort of cringing timidity.
Heaven knew, too, but it won’t tell you.
But it’s an interesting fact.
There’s no knowing what you might build on it.
Ha ha! Take comfort, gentlemen, I’ll reveal it.
You’ve some foolish idea in your hearts.
The prosecutor swallowed this without a murmur.
He was trembling with impatience to hear the new fact.
The valet Smerdyakov, and Heaven.
Write down about Heaven.
That may be of use.
Besides, you will need God yourselves.
And they had already, of course, begun writing it down.
Ha ha! I see through you, Mr.
Confess, and I’ll go on.
But the prosecutor did not confess.
He held his tongue and waited.
I’m not going to shout ‘It’s Smerdyakov,’ said Mitya.
Mitya fixed his eyes on the floor.
Joking apart, he brought out gloomily.
not Smerdyakov, Mitya jerked out with decision.
He has the heart of a chicken.
He has no character worth talking about.
It’s not Smerdyakov, gentlemen.
He doesn’t care for money; he wouldn’t take my presents.
Do you know that? We have heard that legend.
And that’s why it’s so base of you.
He was almost choking.
His request was courteously granted.
After resting, he went on with his story.
But he was evidently depressed.
He was exhausted, mortified and morally shaken.
Mitya was surprised.
And the pestle? The pestle was in my hand.
You wanted to help him? Help!...
Yes, perhaps I did want to help him....
I don’t remember.
I remember everything—every detail.
We have seen your handkerchief.
I couldn’t decide.
I ran away thinking I’d killed him.
And now he’s recovered.
Excellent, commented the prosecutor.
That’s all I wanted.
Well, there you must lie.
and so on.
With painful effort Mitya went on.
That’s quite likely.
It does happen sometimes.
The prosecutor exchanged glances with Nikolay Parfenovitch.
I simply didn’t notice.
You’re quite right there, prosecutor, Mitya assented suddenly.
So I knew it was all over for me....
And behind me disgrace, and that blood—Grigory’s....
Damn it all, gentlemen! Do make haste and finish it.
And I had a note in my pocket already.
I wrote it at Perhotin’s when I loaded my pistols.
Here’s the letter.
Oh, it’s the devil’s doing.
your blood‐stained hands ...
your money ...
a lot of money ...
That’s true, gentlemen.
I remember it was so.
Now, there’s one little point presents itself.
I’m not going to tell you, gentlemen.
You’ve guessed right.
The lawyers were silent for a moment.
You must understand, Mr.
I understand; but still I won’t tell you.
Enough! I’ve heard that rigmarole before, Mitya interrupted again.
You are doing yourself harm, observed Nikolay Parfenovitch nervously.
You can’t believe it all simply on my word.
I understand that, of course.
He relapsed into gloomy silence.
I’m much more good‐natured than you think, gentlemen.
That’s why I can’t tell you.
I can’t for fear of disgrace.
I needn’t have told you.
The prosecutor frowned darkly.
No, no, _c’est fini_, don’t trouble yourselves.
It’s not worth while soiling one’s hands.
I have soiled myself enough through you as it is.
You’re not worth it—no one is ...
I’m not going on.
This was said too peremptorily.
Perhotin’s—how many roubles exactly? I can’t tell you that.
You spoke to Mr.
Perhaps I did.
I won’t say how much I had.
But I’ll tell you if you like.
He told it dryly and curtly.
He told the story without going into motives or details.
And this time the lawyers did not worry him much.
We shall verify all that.
My money, gentlemen? Certainly.
I understand that that is necessary.
I’m surprised, indeed, that you haven’t inquired about it before.
It’s true I couldn’t get away anywhere.
I’m sitting here where I can be seen.
But here’s my money—count it—take it.
That’s all, I think.
And is that all? asked the investigating lawyer.
Nikolay Parfenovitch reckoned it all up.
Mitya helped him readily.
They recollected every farthing and included it in the reckoning.
Nikolay Parfenovitch hurriedly added up the total.
But you asserted it yourself.
Yes, I did, too.
Don’t be anxious about your money.
what is beginning ...
Well, and now....
By all means, gentlemen.
I’ll turn out all my pockets, if you like.
And he did, in fact, begin turning out his pockets.
It will be necessary to take off your clothes, too.
You must take off your clothes.
Who will search them? Behind the curtains, of course.
Nikolay Parfenovitch bent his head in assent.
His small face wore an expression of peculiar solemnity.
From pride and contempt he submitted without a word.
Don’t trouble yourself.
There were bloodstains on the trousers, too.
They communicated their ideas to one another with amazing frankness.
You remember Gridyenko, the copying‐clerk, observed the secretary.
That is, what blood? ...
You must take off your shirt, too.
That’s very important as material evidence.
Mitya flushed red and flew into a rage.
What, am I to stay naked? he shouted.
Don’t disturb yourself.
We will arrange something.
And meanwhile take off your socks.
You’re not joking? Is that really necessary? Mitya’s eyes flashed.
He felt unbearably awkward.
And what was worse, he disliked his feet.
Feeling intolerably ashamed made him, at once and intentionally, rougher.
He pulled off his shirt, himself.
Yes, that can’t be helped for the time....
Kindly sit down here for a while.
I’ll see to all this.
All the things were shown to the witnesses.
Ippolit Kirillovitch went out, too.
Mitya wrapped himself up in the quilt.
He felt cold.
Luckily he had them all in his trunk.
You can keep your own socks and underclothes.
Mitya flew into a passion.
But they succeeded somehow in quieting him down.
taking into consideration the possible outcome of the case.
Mitya at last understood this.
He subsided into gloomy silence and hurriedly dressed himself.
The coat was, besides, ridiculously tight.
Am I to be dressed up like a fool ...
Damn it all! I can hardly button it, Mitya grumbled.
Be so good as to tell Mr.
He understands that, and is sorry ...
He’s come to look at me dressed up, thought Mitya.
He sat down on the same chair as before.
Yes, said the prosecutor thoughtfully, as though reflecting on something.
Ring? repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch with surprise.
Yes, that one ...
That’s a smoky topaz, said Nikolay Parfenovitch, smiling.
Don’t take it off ...
there’s no need....
Exile me, punish me, but don’t bother me any more.
I’ll say no more.
He does not waver.
He adheres to it.
We’ve cross‐examined him several times.
I have cross‐examined him several times, Nikolay Parfenovitch confirmed warmly.
He’s simply raving, from loss of blood, from the wound.
He must have fancied it when he came to....
He couldn’t have seen it ...
I didn’t come from the door, gasped Mitya.
The envelope was empty, and slit open at one end.
Mitya stared at it with open eyes.
But we didn’t find the money in it.
For some seconds Mitya stood as though thunderstruck.
I never knew it.
I’ve never seen it.
This is the first time I’ve looked at it.
I’d only heard of it from Smerdyakov....
Mitya was completely breathless.
We’ve got it written down, confirmed Nikolay Parfenovitch.
And perhaps it wasn’t under the pillow at all....
You must understand that, and arrest him at once....
He gave the signal and father opened to him ...
He sank back helpless in his chair.
All were silent.
Yes, the door!...
Try to enter into our position ...
Mitya was indescribably agitated.
He turned pale.
Very well! he exclaimed suddenly.
I will tell you my secret.
I’ll tell you where I got the money!...
Mitya, it is true, had not heard him.
Mitya’s Great Secret.
The lawyers’ faces lengthened.
That was not at all what they expected.
appropriate it? You mean, ‘steal it’? Speak out plainly now.
And last night I stole it finally.
But not from my father.
Not from my father, don’t be uneasy.
I didn’t steal it from my father, but from her.
Let me tell you without interrupting.
It’s hard to do, you know.
Do you know her? Yes, of course.
I know you know her.
She’s a noble creature, noblest of the noble.
The prosecutor, too, stared.
Yes, I’ve seen that she hated me ...
a long while....
but enough, enough.
You’re unworthy even to know of that.
No need of that at all....
It’s true, I did.
Yet I didn’t spend three thousand, but fifteen hundred.
That’s how it was, gentlemen.
That’s where I got that money yesterday....
This is almost miraculous, murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch.
Do you mean absolutely no one? Absolutely no one.
No one and nobody.
The prosecutor ceased speaking.
He was provoked.
Why? smiled the prosecutor irritably.
and that vileness has been going on a whole month.
I wonder at you.
But I’ll make it clearer.
Perhaps it really is incomprehensible.
You see, attend to what I say.
But it’s strange that you see such a vital difference.
Yes, that was base.
Do you understand now? Both the lawyers laughed aloud.
Why? It’s absurd to ask.
No, gentlemen, one must die honest....
Mitya was pale.
your overwrought nerves, that’s what it is.
I assure you I’m in earnest....
of that feminine jealousy ...
and particularly for you, particularly important for you.
Have mercy, gentlemen! Mitya flung up his hands.
Don’t write that, anyway; have some shame.
Well, you see, all bear witness to it.
And the word _all_ means something.
It means nothing.
I talked rot, and every one began repeating it.
From bravado perhaps ...
at having wasted so much money....
yes, that was why ...
damn it ...
You’d better show us the remains of it.
You must have them somewhere.
Damnation, what nonsense! I don’t know where they are.
Why scissors? It was an old rag.
It was torn in a minute.
Where did you put it afterwards? I dropped it there.
It would be material evidence in your favor.
I did it myself.
No knowledge was needed to do that.
And we are in no mood for laughing, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.
I might have torn a bit off my linen.
That’s very interesting.
Wait a bit....
I believe I didn’t tear it off anything.
It was a bit of calico....
In your landlady’s cap? Yes.
I took it from her.
An old piece of calico, washed a thousand times.
I think it was in the cap.
I won’t say any more.
Enough of it! said Mitya, losing his temper at last.
Enough, gentlemen, enough! he decided, in an exhausted voice.
I ought not to have been so ready.
I see that from your eyes.
The lawyers were silent.
They had immediately to begin examining the witnesses.
It was by now eight o’clock in the morning.
The lights had been extinguished long ago.
The lawyers, too, looked very tired.
Mitya gazed blankly out of the window.
Oh, as much as you like, the latter replied.
Mitya got up and went to the window....
The rain lashed against its little greenish panes.
Set your mind completely at rest.
Gentlemen, I thank you.
You’ve taken a load off my heart....
Well, what are we to do now? I’m ready.
Well, we ought to make haste.
We must pass to examining the witnesses without delay.
Tea really was ready below, and was soon brought up.
He looked surprisingly exhausted.
The Evidence Of The Witnesses.
The Babe The examination of the witnesses began.
The first witness examined was Trifon Borissovitch.
Mitya was sitting sideways with his back to the curtains.
It makes no difference now.
fifteen hundred, indeed! We’ve seen money too.
We can judge of amounts....
Come now, is that so, Trifon Borissovitch? replied Mitya.
You said it before Andrey.
Andrey himself is still here.
Send for him.
Maybe he’d remember it....
The peasants and the driver unhesitatingly confirmed Trifon Borissovitch’s evidence.
He affirmed that the Poles had cheated at cards.
Mitya did not once pull Kalganov up.
The Poles, too, were examined.
His name was Mussyalovitch.
Pan Vrublevsky turned out to be an uncertificated dentist.
Mitya fumed with rage.
He’s a scoundrel! A scoundrel! You can put that down.
The prosecutor positively pounced on this piece of evidence.
The prosecutor positively smiled at the innocence of this subterfuge.
Then they let the Poles go.
There had been drinking and disorder enough, that night....
Then old Maximov was summoned.
It was a very thick bundle, all rainbow‐colored notes.
And Dmitri Fyodorovitch’s were all rainbow‐colored....
He was not kept long.
At last it was Grushenka’s turn.
Mihail Makarovitch himself led Grushenka in.
Nikolay Parfenovitch was even a little bit fascinated.
But her face reassured him at once.
I was expecting another man who had wronged me.
Nikolay Parfenovitch immediately acted upon this hint.
Did he never say before you ...
I had faith in his noble heart.
You can speak, Nikolay Parfenovitch assented.
Grushenka stood up and crossed herself devoutly before the ikon.
He’s telling the whole truth, you may believe it.
She went out.
His eyes were closing with fatigue.
The examination of the witnesses was, at last, over.
They proceeded to a final revision of the protocol.
And in her arms was a little baby crying.
It’s the babe, answered the driver, the babe weeping.
There seemed more pity in it.
But why is it? Why? foolish Mitya still persisted.
Why, they’re poor people, burnt out.
They’ve no bread.
They’re begging because they’ve been burnt out.
No, no, Mitya, as it were, still did not understand.
And I’m coming with you.
Mitya listened attentively, and only shrugged his shoulders.
Well, gentlemen, I don’t blame you.
I understand that there’s nothing else for you to do.
Still I mean to fight it out with you.
I warn you of that.
Oh, I was still such a fool then....
Saying good‐by to you, I say it to all men.
Mitya instantly noticed this, and started.
He let his outstretched hand fall at once.
in your defense....
Certainly, but considering ...
Grushenka made a deep bow to Mitya.
Farewell; you are guiltless, though you’ve been your own undoing.
Her lips quivered, tears flowed from her eyes.
He was shouting angrily.
Trifon Borissovitch came down the steps too.
All stared at Mitya.
Forgive us too! he heard two or three voices.
He was, perhaps, too busy.
He, too, was shouting and fussing about something.
But Akim was not to be seen.
They ran to look for him.
The peasant persisted and besought them to wait.
You see what our peasants are, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch.
They’ve no shame! exclaimed Trifon Borissovitch.
Akim gave you twenty‐five copecks the day before yesterday.
You’ve drunk it all and now you cry out.
Let’s start with the one, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch.
Mitya was reduced to silence.
He flushed all over.
A moment later he felt suddenly very cold.
I’ve taken a chill, thought Mitya, twitching his shoulders.
He had no cap on.
Mitya had time to seize and press his hand.
But the cart moved and their hands parted.
The bell began ringing and Mitya was driven off.
Oh, he believed almost without doubt in Mitya’s guilt.
At that moment he had no desire to live.
PART IV Book X.
The Boys Kolya Krassotkin It was the beginning of November.
It was a dull morning, but the snow had ceased.
But the boy could take his own part.
Above all, he knew where to draw the line.
He was extremely vain.
His mother was mistaken; he was very fond of her.
The boys assembled.
It was a pitch‐dark night without a moon.
At the time fixed, Kolya lay down between the rails.
The boys rushed to Kolya.
He lay without moving.
They began pulling at him, lifting him up.
He suddenly got up and walked away without a word.
Kolya, too, kept him at a respectful distance.
But of this later.
It was Sunday and there was no school.
The one thing that troubled Kolya was the kids.
The two kids adored him.
But Kolya was bothered and did not go in.
Twitching all over, he even uttered a plaintive whine.
Kolya opened the door to peep at the kids.
Kolya whistled to himself.
Kostya stared at Nastya and listened, pondering profoundly.
You know nothing about it, she snapped irritably.
Well, perhaps so, Kostya agreed, entirely vanquished.
But you didn’t say so before.
You’re terrible people, I see.
I must go out.
The children’s faces instantly brightened.
Show us the cannon, said Kostya, beaming all over.
He rolled the toy on along the table.
And it can be fired off, too.
It can be loaded with shot and fired off.
The children listened with intense interest.
What particularly struck their imagination was that the cannon kicked.
And have you got any powder? Nastya inquired.
He had some shot, too, in a screw of paper.
But Kostya liked the shot better.
And does the shot burn? he inquired.
No, it doesn’t.
Mother never does whip us, Nastya observed at once.
I know, I only said it to finish the sentence.
Only think, a dog! Agafya observed sententiously.
Why are you late, female? asked Krassotkin sternly.
Female, indeed! Go on with you, you brat.
Brat? Yes, a brat.
And what am I going to swear for? laughed Agafya.
I shall look after them without that.
No, you must swear on your eternal salvation.
Else I shan’t go.
Well, don’t then.
She will give you some lunch, too.
Good‐by, chickens, I go with my heart at rest.
At last he could go out.
He was the one who told Alyosha Karamazov about Ilusha.
I am late, answered Krassotkin.
I was detained by circumstances.
You’re taking him, too? Yes.
Ah! if it were only Zhutchka! That’s impossible.
Zhutchka is lost in the mists of obscurity.
Ah! couldn’t we do this? Smurov suddenly stood still.
Heaven forbid! I know what I am about.
He thinks that would comfort Ilusha; but I doubt it.
He tried to walk, but he couldn’t stand.
He won’t live another week.
Herzenstube is looking after him.
Now they are rich again—they’ve got heaps of money.
They are rogues.
I don’t believe in medicine.
It’s a useless institution.
I mean to go into all that.
There’s nothing in that.
There’s no sentimentality about it.
My dear boy, that’s my business, not yours.
It’s a stupid expression.
It’s not Karamazov at all; it’s not his doing.
Our fellows began going there of themselves.
Of course, they went with Karamazov at first.
And there’s been nothing of that sort—no silliness.
First one went, and then another.
His father was awfully pleased to see us.
He sees that Ilusha’s dying.
Ilusha asked after you, that was all.
He just asks and says no more.
He behaved like a madman before.
You know he is a very decent man.
We made a mistake then.
Karamazov’s a riddle to me all the same.
Kolya subsided into dignified silence.
Smurov, too, was silent.
Yes; it’s a funny habit.
No, it’s not funny; you are wrong there.
That’s Rakitin’s idea—a remarkable idea.
I am a Socialist, Smurov.
And what is a Socialist? asked Smurov.
You are not old enough to understand that yet.
It’s cold, though.
Yes, twelve degrees of frost.
Father looked at the thermometer just now.
It’s because people are not used to it.
Habit is the great motive‐power.
His long fair beard was all white with frost.
Don’t provoke him, observed Smurov.
Is your name Matvey? Yes.
Didn’t you know? No, I didn’t.
It was a guess.
You get whipped, I expect? Nothing to speak of—sometimes.
Does it hurt? Well, yes, it does.
You are a nice chap, that you are.
The boys went on.
That was a nice peasant, Kolya observed to Smurov.
I had to say that to please him.
I like people to understand at the first word.
Some things can’t be explained.
But you don’t understand that.
One has to know how to talk to the peasants.
So you’re afraid? Don’t laugh, Kolya.
Of course I’m afraid.
My father would be awfully cross.
I am strictly forbidden to go out with you.
Don’t be uneasy, nothing will happen this time.
I am so glad it’s Marya.
I can’t stay now.
You shall tell me next Sunday.
I’ve nothing to tell you next Sunday.
You set upon me, you impudent young monkey.
I didn’t say anything, bawled Marya.
Do you? he asked sarcastically.
I know you! I know you! the man repeated idiotically.
So much the better for you.
Well, it’s time I was going.
Not my business? No; it’s not your business.
Kolya scanned him gravely.
What Sabaneyev? No, I don’t know him.
The women laughed.
The young man stared at her wildly.
For the Kuzmitchovs? repeated another woman.
But his name wasn’t Trifon.
Alexey Ivanitch is his name.
Tchizhov, Alexey Ivanitch.
The bewildered youth gazed from one to another.
‘Do you know Sabaneyev?’ says he.
What Tchizhov? Who is he? Tell me, if you know.
Don’t you really know him? Know whom? Tchizhov.
The devil take Tchizhov and you with him.
I’ll give him a hiding, that I will.
I’ll give the boy a hiding.
There’s another blockhead, that peasant there.
Let’s go on.
Nothing could stop me, now I am once off.
He seemed not quite sober.
And if I am? laughed Kolya.
Well, a joke’s a joke.
I don’t mind.
There’s no harm in a joke.
I beg your pardon, brother, it was a joke.
I say, you seem a clever peasant.
I doubt it, said Kolya, somewhat taken aback.
It’s true, though.
Perhaps it is.
It is, brother.
In the distance the cathedral clock struck half‐past eleven.
Why ask him to come out? Smurov protested.
Yes, he had long wanted to meet him.
It’s a pity I am so short, though.
But I have a clever face.
I am not good‐looking.
I know I’m hideous, but I’ve a clever face.
Alyosha came out quickly and hastened up to Kolya.
He had evidently come in haste.
He held out his hand to Kolya at once.
Anyway, I am glad to make your acquaintance.
We should have met anyway.
Tell me, how are things going? Ilusha is very ill.
He is certainly dying.
before the incident ...
with the knife....
Then there’s another reason....
Tell me, is that your dog? Yes, Perezvon.
I’ve heard all about it.
Kolya smiled mysteriously.
Listen, Karamazov, I’ll tell you all about it.
They began teasing Ilusha at once.
I like children like that.
And they teased him all the more.
They worried him about it; they jeered at him.
That I can’t stand.
I saw the boy was proud.
On Sundays, too.
If it’s my fancy, that’s enough.
I am teaching him, developing him.
Let us get to the point, though.
I did it on purpose: that was my idea.
and besides ...
no doubt, you understand me at a word.
I wondered what the tragedy was.
That was Ilusha’s own account of it.
He confessed it to me, and cried bitterly.
He hugged me, shaking all over.
He was tormented by remorse, I could see that.
I took it seriously.
I did what I thought best at the time.
That was my intention.
And just then that affair with his father happened.
They seem to have given him one very bad beating.
I stood a few yards off, looking on.
But he suddenly met my eyes.
I didn’t move.
I don’t mind owning I am plucky sometimes, Karamazov.
And the wound was a mere scratch.
I am sorry for it now.
But I had a special reason.
So now I’ve told you all about it ...
but I’m afraid it was stupid of me.
We have all rested our hopes on you.
Smurov said something of the sort.
And so we did.
I understand you, Karamazov.
I see you understand human nature, Kolya added, with feeling.
You’ve no overcoat on in this bitter cold.
You see what an egoist I am.
Why so? It’s so trivial, so ordinary.
You are thirteen? asked Alyosha.
I hate being asked my age, more than that ...
and in fact ...
But they’ve always got some silly tale.
But that’s only natural.
Oh, you know, that’s rather an interesting view.
When I go home, I’ll think it over.
I’ll admit I thought I might learn something from you.
Kolya was much pleased with Alyosha.
That’s why I’ve come.
Oh, I’m only coming in for a minute.
I’ll keep on my overcoat.
Perezvon will stay here in the passage and be dead.
I’ll arrange it all and you’ll see something.
It was a great consolation to Ilusha in his suffering.
That was a fortnight before this Sunday.
His father was terribly concerned about him.
But during the last few days she had completely changed.
The captain noticed the change in her with mournful perplexity.
She called some of them to her and kissed them.
She was particularly fond of Smurov.
Clearly he liked the puppy, but ...
Krassotkin! cried one of the boys suddenly.
He was the first to see him come in.
The captain ran eagerly to meet Kolya.
Please come in ...
you are welcome! he said hurriedly.
That’s how they ride in.
Kolya was already by Ilusha’s bedside.
The sick boy turned visibly paler.
For a minute they were silent again.
Ye—es, answered Ilusha in a long whisper, gasping for breath.
He’ll be a huge dog! cried one of the boys.
I came with Perezvon.
I’ve got a dog now, called Perezvon.
A Slavonic name.
He’s out there ...
if I whistle, he’ll run in.
Ilusha’s little face quivered.
He looked with an agonized expression at Kolya.
is Zhutchka? Ilusha asked in a broken voice.
It must have run away and died somewhere.
But I’ve got a dog, Perezvon ...
A Slavonic name....
I’ve brought him to show you.
I don’t want him! said Ilusha suddenly.
No, no, you really must see him ...
it will amuse you.
I brought him on purpose....
He’s the same sort of shaggy dog....
There was a reproachful light in his eyes.
another time, he muttered, but Kolya could not be restrained.
Perezvon dashed headlong into the room.
It was by that I found him.
I found him directly.
He used to live in the Fedotovs’ back‐yard.
I found him....
You did not see him do it.
He ran away squealing and you thought he’d swallowed it.
Ilusha could not speak.
As for the captain he behaved like a small child.
And I never guessed! cried Smurov regretfully.
Here he’s found him! another boy repeated gleefully.
Krassotkin’s a brick! cried a third voice.
I’ll tell you how it happened, that’s the whole point.
And meanwhile I taught the dog all sorts of tricks.
The boys laughed.
The captain ran back with a piece of cooked beef.
Dogs don’t like hot things.
No, it’s all right.
But he kept Perezvon only for a brief moment.
The audience, of course, expressed enthusiasm and surprise.
Simply for that! answered Kolya, with perfect simplicity.
I wanted to show him in all his glory.
Dear, dear! kept exclaiming the captain.
Kolya sat down again on the edge of the bed.
Ilusha, I can show you another trick.
I’ve brought you a little cannon.
Well, here, I’ve brought it to you.
He hurried, because he was happy himself.
And Morozov has a taste for such things.
He was grateful to me, too....
Kolya showed the powder and the shot.
A magnificent explosion followed.
Mamma was startled, but at once laughed with delight.
The boys gazed in speechless triumph.
Kolya was disconcerted.
The captain fidgeted uneasily.
Take it, mother, here, keep it! Ilusha cried.
She was so touched that she cried.
Mamma, let me kiss your hand.
We make the powder ourselves now.
Not real? Kolya flushed.
I don’t know, of course.
I don’t know, you know best.
but of course you know best, I don’t know....
Yes, answered Ilusha.
He listened to Kolya with immense interest and enjoyment.
His father saw it.
They say I’m a ‘desperate character,’ Kolya smiled scornfully.
It all began from what happened on the railway.
N—not particularly, answered Kolya carelessly.
They told me, but I didn’t understand.
I stopped and looked at them.
I like talking to the peasants....
We’ve dropped behind the peasants—that’s an axiom.
But I was telling you about the goose.
‘Do you see that cart full of oats?’ I said.
‘Come on, then,’ said I, ‘let’s try.’ ‘Let’s,’ he said.
The goose’s neck was broken in half.
Well, of course, there were witnesses.
And he was warned not to play such pranks again.
And the fellow kept blubbering like a woman.
He was particularly pleased with the story of the goose.
Ilusha looked at Kolya with infinite happiness.
Oh, that’s all nonsense about Troy, a trivial matter.
He was silent and seemed to be shy.
He was a pretty boy of about eleven, called Kartashov.
He was sitting near the door.
Kolya looked at him with dignified amazement.
But now he couldn’t resist saying it.
For weeks he had been longing to.
The offending boy turned from pink to crimson.
He was silent and on the point of tears.
Kolya held him so for a minute.
Universal history? the captain inquired, looking almost scared.
But Alyosha was still silent and still serious as before.
The classical languages, too ...
they are simply madness, nothing more.
By degrees Kolya began to get breathless again.
His cheeks were flushed.
He had listened attentively.
You don’t agree, Karamazov? Why ‘fraud’? Alyosha smiled again.
Mamma pulled herself together and assumed a dignified air.
The boys hurriedly took leave.
Some of them promised to come again in the evening.
Kolya called Perezvon and the dog jumped off the bed.
The captain, bent double, was bowing low before him.
Sne‐gi‐ryov? the doctor said loudly and pompously.
Where is the patient? he asked emphatically.
I think that’s certain, answered Alyosha, mournfully.
I wanted to know you for a long time.
I am only sorry we meet in such sad circumstances.
Alyosha noticed this, smiled, and pressed his hand.
I know you are a mystic, but ...
that hasn’t put me off.
Contact with real life will cure you....
It’s always so with characters like yours.
Oh, God and all the rest of it.
Of course, God is only a hypothesis, but ...
I admit that He is needed ...
for the order of the universe and all that ...
And all of a sudden he felt horribly annoyed.
Have you read Voltaire? Alyosha finished.
No, not to say read....
But I’ve read _Candide_ in the Russian translation ...
in an absurd, grotesque, old translation ...
That is ...
Kolya was getting mixed by now.
A Socialist? laughed Alyosha.
I can think for myself....
I am not opposed to Christ, if you like.
There’s no doubt about that.
Rakitin, of course, but ...
old Byelinsky said that, too, so they say.
Byelinsky? I don’t remember.
He hasn’t written that anywhere.
If he didn’t write it, they say he said it.
I heard that from a ...
but never mind.
And have you read Byelinsky? Well, no ...
I haven’t read all of him, but ...
Didn’t go off with Onyegin? Surely you don’t ...
But please don’t suppose I am such a revolutionist.
I often disagree with Mr.
_Les femmes tricottent_, as Napoleon said.
There’s a perfect mass of fruitful activity open to us.
That’s what I answered.
I say this only to you.
Long will you remember The house at the Chain bridge.
Do you remember? It’s splendid.
But tell me, have you read Pushkin—_Onyegin_, for instance?...
You spoke just now of Tatyana.
What makes you ask? Oh, nothing.
But it’s true that I am stupidly sensitive, crudely sensitive.
I’ll tell you why I smiled.
But the German was right all the same.
Bravo the German! But Germans want strangling all the same.
Strangled, what for? smiled Alyosha.
Well, perhaps I am talking nonsense, I agree.
I liked that Nina, you know.
That would have more effect on you than anything.
Yes, it’s a great pity.
I see that now.
Oh, Karamazov, I am profoundly unhappy.
And you worry every one about you, smiled Alyosha.
Yes, I worry every one about me, especially my mother.
Nowadays the very children have begun to suffer from it.
It’s almost a sort of insanity.
Only you must not be like everybody else, that’s all.
You be the only one not like it.
Splendid! I was not mistaken in you.
You know how to console one.
Alyosha smiled brightly.
I see it by your eyes.
Kolya smiled with a sort of sly happiness.
he muttered, almost embarrassed.
His cheeks glowed, his eyes beamed.
I know, I know.
How you know it all beforehand! Kolya agreed at once.
Just so, hurrah! You are a prophet.
I loved you awfully.
I’ve been loving and dreaming of you.
Your Excellency, your Excellency ...
your Excellency ...
he stopped suddenly.
If you could, for instance ...
your patient ...
Syracuse is in Sicily, Kolya jerked out suddenly in explanation.
The doctor looked at him.
Well, that’s not my business, grinned the doctor.
There was a wrathful note in Kolya’s voice.
Perezvon?[7] repeated the doctor, perplexed.
Good‐by, we shall meet in Syracuse.
Kolya, hold your tongue! he cried to Krassotkin.
Take no notice of him, doctor, he repeated, rather impatiently.
Perezvon flew after him.
this is ...
Alyosha followed Kolya into the room.
He was already by Ilusha’s bedside.
A minute later the captain, too, came back.
Father, father, come ...
the doctor said ...
you would be all right ...
we shall be happy ...
the doctor ...
the captain began.
and Perezvon ...
I shall expect you....
Father, father! His voice broke.
They were all three silent, still embracing.
Ilusha! Ilusha! she exclaimed.
Krassotkin suddenly released himself from Ilusha’s embrace.
Good‐by! And he ran out into the passage.
Alyosha found him crying.
His face looked frenzied, his lips were trembling.
He stood before the two and flung up his arms.
Kolya ran out into the street.
I will certainly come in the evening.
What was that he said about Jerusalem?...
What did he mean by that? It’s from the Bible.
For one whole week she was unconscious.
There was scarcely a trace of her former frivolity.
Alyosha knew that she was fearfully jealous of her.
Sometimes he was unable to say anything.
Full of anxiety he entered her lodging.
She was at home.
But Grushenka sent almost every day to inquire after him.
Ah, how I need you! Sit down to the table.
I am very hungry.
Fenya, Fenya, coffee, cried Grushenka.
It’s been made a long time ready for you.
And bring some little pies, and mind they are hot.
Grushenka said all this in one breath in her agitation.
What did you quarrel about this time? asked Alyosha.
I didn’t expect it in the least.
Only fancy, he is jealous of the Pole.
‘Why are you keeping him?’ he said.
I am ashamed to repeat what he said.
Silly fellow! Rakitin went in as I came out.
Perhaps Rakitin is egging him on.
What do you think? she added carelessly.
And now he is particularly worried.
I should think he might be, with the trial to‐morrow.
Jealous of you? Grushenka laughed in spite of herself.
Don’t ogle the pies.
I don’t deserve your kindness.
I’ve been to see him also.
And I shall send him some pies, too, on purpose.
She could not attend to letters then.
Grushenka left that letter, too, unanswered.
Grushenka simply laughed, and gave her former admirer ten roubles.
I was laughing, telling Mitya about it.
I wouldn’t tell him for anything, said Alyosha, smiling.
Ech! You think he is unhappy about it.
Why, he’s jealous on purpose.
He doesn’t care, said Grushenka bitterly.
On purpose? queried Alyosha.
I tell you you are silly, Alyosha.
You know nothing about it, with all your cleverness.
I would be offended if he were not jealous.
I am like that.
I am not offended at jealousy.
I have a fierce heart, too.
I can be jealous myself.
I tell you he is jealous now _on purpose_.
He wants to throw the whole blame on me.
She hid her eyes in her handkerchief and sobbed violently.
He doesn’t love Katerina Ivanovna, said Alyosha firmly.
Her face was distorted.
No one cares about it.
Now he is lying very ill.
He has been ill ever since that attack.
Really ill, added Alyosha.
I saw him yesterday.
Well? Did you talk to him? Grushenka put in eagerly.
He listened and said nothing.
He told me that he had already formed his opinion.
But he promised to give my words consideration.
Consideration! Ah, they are swindlers! They’ll ruin him.
Even Fenya’s evidence went to prove he had done it.
Yes, there’s a fearful accumulation of evidence, Alyosha observed grimly.
I went and talked to him myself.
He’s rude about it, too.
Yes, that’s perhaps the strongest evidence against him, said Alyosha.
‘Why is the babe poor?’ he said.
‘It’s for that babe I am going to Siberia now.
He cried himself, and I cried, too.
that’s not Rakitin’s doing.
I didn’t see Mitya yesterday.
I’ll see him to‐day.
Alyosha gazed at her in amazement.
He came secretly.
Alyosha sat plunged in thought, considering something.
The news evidently impressed him.
He’s said very little to me these last two months.
if he was there a week ago ...
there certainly has been a change in Mitya this week.
There has been a change, Grushenka assented quickly.
But you said he was worried.
Yes, he is worried and yet cheerful.
That’s why I sent for you.
I don’t know.
Perhaps he wants to tell me, but doesn’t dare to.
He warns me.
It’s all Katerina, it all comes from her.
He tells me that beforehand—warns me.
Alyosha, I’ve been wanting to ask you a long time.
I won’t tell you a lie.
Ivan is not in love with Katerina Ivanovna, I think.
He said that to me, to me.
I’ll tell everything then! And again she cried bitterly.
I do know.
Then I’ll come to you to‐day, and tell you.
I fancy ...
Good‐by for now.
Alyosha shook hands with her.
Grushenka was still crying.
He had a great many things to do still.
Madame Hohlakov was lying on a couch.
She greeted Alyosha with cries of rapture.
You have come to see Lise.
Dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, I trust you implicitly with my Lise.
Please remind me of it yourself.
Ready to die of curiosity....
That doctor was with us yesterday and saw Lise....
I paid him fifty roubles for the visit.
But that’s not the point, that’s not the point again.
You see, I’m mixing everything up.
I am in such a hurry.
Why am I in a hurry? I don’t understand.
It’s awful how I seem growing unable to understand anything.
Everything seems mixed up in a sort of tangle.
Where? At Agrafena Alexandrovna’s.
I know nothing about it though.
She had better have done it before.
This awful trial ...
I shall certainly go, I am making arrangements.
I shall have people with me.
And, you know, I am a witness.
I can sit up.
All grow old and have death to look forward to.
Well, so be it! I am weary.
This Katya, _cette charmante personne_, has disappointed all my hopes.
It drives me out of my mind.
Worst of all—the publicity.
I got the paper and read it yesterday.
Here, in the Petersburg paper _Gossip_.
The paper began coming out this year.
(That, alas! was the name of our little town.
No names appeared, in fact.
Well, that must be me, she hurried on again.
Of course I am meant.
Perhaps, said Alyosha, though I’ve heard nothing about it.
It’s he, it’s he! No ‘perhaps’ about it.
You know I turned him out of the house....
from you, at least.
I meet him very seldom now, indeed.
We are not friends.
Well, then, I’ll tell you all about it.
You must forgive me, Alyosha.
I am like a mother to you....
No, no; quite the contrary.
I called you a monk just now.
I only noticed it later.
I knew nothing about it ...
You met him here ever so many times yourself.
He is a future diplomat.
Wait a minute—how did it go? A captivating little foot.
It began somehow like that.
I can never remember poetry.
I’ve got it here.
I’ll show it to you later.
But he says that on purpose.
But they are good poetry.
You’ve no humane ideas,’ said he.
And, you know, Pyotr Ilyitch is anything but a coward.
‘I’d no idea,’ said he.
‘I shouldn’t have said it, if I had known.
I should have praised it.
Poets are all so irritable,’ he said.
He explained to me afterwards that it was all sarcastic.
I thought he was in earnest.
Of course, there was a fuss.
Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, I know myself I did wrong.
I was putting it on.
I read it and gasped.
Who could have written it? He must have written it.
It was a fortnight ago, you see.
Listen, what is an aberration? What aberration? asked Alyosha, wondering.
In the legal sense.
An aberration in which everything is pardonable.
Whatever you do, you will be acquitted at once.
What do you mean? I’ll tell you.
This Katya ...
I simply said to myself, ‘Well, so be it.
I don’t care’...
I was talking of aberration.
This doctor has come.
You wrote for him.
No, it wasn’t you, but Katya.
It’s all Katya’s doing.
It’s all the good effect of the reformed law courts.
‘How did he seem then?’ he asked me.
He must have been in a state of aberration.
But he didn’t murder him, Alyosha interrupted rather sharply.
He felt more and more sick with anxiety and impatience.
Grigory? cried Alyosha.
Yes, yes; it was Grigory.
But why, why? Suffering from aberration.
I read that lately, and all the doctors confirm it.
The doctors are always confirming; they confirm anything.
Why, my Lise is in a state of aberration.
Oh, Lise grieves me so! I believe she’s quite mad.
Alyosha got up resolutely.
He had not sat down again and listened standing.
That’s six days ago now.
He came, stayed five minutes, and went away.
I sent for Lise directly.
She suddenly screamed out, ‘I hate Ivan Fyodorovitch.
That’s monstrous; I am always polite to my servants.
I can stand no more.
then something awful will happen.
What does the counsel say.
Where are you off to, Alexey Fyodorovitch? To Lise.
She was positively thinner.
She did not hold out her hand to him.
How do you know? asked Alyosha.
I’ve been listening.
I don’t apologize.
You are not fit to be a husband.
She suddenly laughed.
Lise laughed nervously again; she spoke rapidly.
I sent your brother, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, some sweets in prison.
I don’t want to be happy.
You are in love with disorder? Yes, I want disorder.
I keep wanting to set fire to the house.
And I shall know and say nothing.
It’s your luxurious life, said Alyosha, softly.
That’s what your monk taught you.
That’s not true.
It bores me.
He is always wandering about, dreaming.
Can you spin tops? Yes.
You are not ashamed to be with me? No.
I don’t want to be holy.
God will censure you.
Alyosha was watching her steadily.
That’s just what I should like.
It’s a sort of disease.
Why do evil? So that everything might be destroyed.
That would be awfully nice.
Why would it be so nice, Alyosha? I don’t know.
It happens sometimes.
I not only say it, I shall do it.
I believe you.
Ah, how I love you for saying you believe me.
And you are not lying one little bit.
There is a little.
What struck Alyosha above everything was her earnestness.
There are moments when people love crime, said Alyosha thoughtfully.
And are you still reading nasty books? Yes, I am.
I for one love it.
Oh, what ideas you have! Lise shrieked in delight.
Oh, I must tell you a funny dream of mine.
I sometimes dream of devils.
And they are just coming, just seizing me.
It’s awful fun.
it takes one’s breath away.
I’ve had the same dream, too, said Alyosha suddenly.
Really? cried Lise, surprised.
I say, Alyosha, don’t laugh, that’s awfully important.
I talk to no one but myself and you.
Only you in the whole world.
And to you more readily than to myself.
I am awfully fond of pineapple _compote_.
Do you like it? Alyosha looked at her in silence.
Her pale, sallow face was suddenly contorted, her eyes burned.
_All_ about it, _all_, and said that it was nice.
He laughed and said it really was nice.
Then he got up and went away.
He was only here five minutes.
Did you send him a letter? Yes.
He answered, laughed, got up and went away.
That person behaved honorably, Alyosha murmured.
He is very ill now, too, Lise.
He doesn’t despise any one, Alyosha went on.
Only he does not believe any one.
Then he despises me, me? You, too.
Good, Lise seemed to grind her teeth.
And she laughed in Alyosha’s face, a feverish malicious laugh.
Save me! she almost groaned.
But I do love you! answered Alyosha warmly.
And will you weep over me, will you? Yes.
Thank you! It’s only your tears I want.
For I don’t love any one.
He looked quickly at Lise.
Her face had become almost menacing.
And she slammed the door quickly.
The bolt clicked.
It was beginning to get dusk.
But Alyosha knew that he would be admitted without difficulty.
Things were managed in our little town, as everywhere else.
His first horror had been succeeded by pity.
But Alyosha had an irresistible attraction for him.
They were both talking loudly.
Rakitin did not like meeting Alyosha, especially of late.
He scarcely spoke to him, and bowed to him stiffly.
Then he began looking at once for his umbrella.
Rakitin fired up instantly.
What’s the matter? I was joking, cried Mitya.
He didn’t even nod to you.
But never mind.
We’ll make up for it now.
Great friends with Rakitin? No, not as much as that.
But he is a clever fellow, very clever.
Well, Alexey, it’s all over with me now.
Yes, the trial’s to‐morrow.
He means to go to Petersburg.
There he’ll go in for criticism of an elevating tendency.
It makes my heart yearn to look at you.
Who was Karl Bernard? Karl Bernard? Alyosha was surprised again.
No, not Karl.
Stay, I made a mistake.
Well, damn him, then! I don’t know either, swore Mitya.
A scoundrel of some sort, most likely.
They are all scoundrels.
And Rakitin will make his way.
Rakitin will get on anywhere; he is another Bernard.
Ugh, these Bernards! They are all over the place.
But what is the matter? Alyosha asked insistently.
That’s what he comes for; he said so himself.
He wants to prove some theory.
He explained it all to me.
He can’t bear Ivan, he hates him.
He’s not fond of you, either.
Awfully conceited, though.
Why is it all over with me? H’m!...
The fact of it is ...
and when they quiver, then an image appears ...
And Rakitin does dislike God.
But they conceal it.
They tell lies.
‘Will you preach this in your reviews?’ I asked him.
He talks a lot of sense, too.
He began reading me an article last week.
I copied out three lines of it.
Wait a minute.
Here it is.
He looked at Mitya and listened to him with curiosity.
I don’t understand either.
It’s dark and obscure, but intellectual.
He writes poetry, too, the rascal.
He’s written in honor of Madame Hohlakov’s foot.
Ha ha ha! I’ve heard about it, said Alyosha.
Have you? And have you heard the poem? No.
I’ve got it.
Here it is.
I’ll read it to you.
And he made me believe it.
He came to see me every day.
‘She is coming round,’ he declared.
He was beaming with delight.
And he had written this doggerel.
He’s a waggish fellow.
He’s written a paragraph about Madame Hohlakov.
And Alyosha told him briefly about the paragraph in _Gossip_.
That’s his doing, that’s his doing! Mitya assented, frowning.
That’s him! These paragraphs ...
I know ...
And about Katya, too....
H’m! He walked across the room with a harassed air.
Brother, I cannot stay long, Alyosha said, after a pause.
No, don’t be amazed at me, Mitya broke in warmly.
Hush! He went up to Alyosha excitedly and kissed him.
His eyes glowed.
That’s why I was thirsting for you.
Now I can wait no longer.
I must pour out my heart to you.
A new man has risen up in me.
It’s for the babe I’m going.
Because we are all responsible for all.
I didn’t kill father, but I’ve got to go.
I accept it.
But I’ve been longing for you.
I am not afraid of it now.
I was afraid of it before.
Ivan is not Rakitin, there is an idea in him.
It’s God that’s worrying me.
That’s the only thing that’s worrying me.
I always come back to that.
Rakitin says that one can love humanity without God.
Well, only a sniveling idiot can maintain that.
I can’t understand it.
Life’s easy for Rakitin.
But after all, what is goodness? Answer me that, Alexey.
Vanity! Ivan has no God.
He has an idea.
It’s beyond me.
But he is silent.
I believe he is a free‐mason.
I asked him, but he is silent.
But once he did drop a word.
What did he say? Alyosha took it up quickly.
That was all he said.
That was going one better than Rakitin.
Yes, Alyosha assented bitterly.
I have said nothing about Ivan to you before.
I put it off to the last.
I’ll tell you everything.
We’ve something tremendous on hand....
And you shall be my judge in it.
But don’t begin about that now; be silent.
Only imagine, he believes I did it.
I see it.
Grigory sticks to his point.
Grigory’s honest, but a fool.
Grigory’s my enemy.
I mean Katerina Ivanovna.
She’ll pay it back to the last farthing.
I wonder how I can stand it.
I don’t pity her.
It’s her own doing.
She deserves what she gets.
I shall have my own story to tell, Alexey.
He smiled bitterly again.
She was with me just now....
Confound my temper! It was jealousy.
I was sorry, I kissed her as she was going.
I didn’t ask her forgiveness.
Why didn’t you? exclaimed Alyosha.
Suddenly Mitya laughed almost mirthfully.
But try acknowledging you are in fault to a woman.
And even the best, the best of them do it.
That’s my conviction—not conviction, but feeling.
I worship her, Alexey, worship her.
Only she doesn’t see it.
No, she still thinks I don’t love her enough.
And she tortures me, tortures me with her love.
I imagine something every day....
Mitya listened, made him repeat things, and seemed pleased.
I can’t endure it.
We shall fight.
But I shall love her, I shall love her infinitely.
And without her I can’t exist....
Mitya walked frowning across the room.
It was almost dark.
He suddenly seemed terribly worried.
No, my good Grushenka, that’s not it.
I will tell you all our secret, Mitya whispered hurriedly.
It’s your decision will decide it.
Perhaps it’s you that is superior and not Ivan.
Don’t decide it now.
I’ll tell you now.
You listen, but don’t decide.
Stand and keep quiet.
I won’t tell you everything.
Not a question, not a movement.
Oo! I’m afraid! Alyosha, listen! Ivan suggests my _escaping_.
Hush, don’t decide.
I should go to America with Grusha.
A sign has come, I reject the sign.
There’s no one else.
They’ll say I’m out of my mind or a fool.
Ivan understands about the hymn, too.
He understands, only he doesn’t answer—he doesn’t speak.
He doesn’t believe in the hymn.
Don’t speak, don’t speak.
I see how you look! You have already decided.
Don’t decide, spare me! I can’t live without Grusha.
Wait till after the trial! Mitya ended beside himself.
Alyosha listened with extreme surprise and was deeply moved.
Tell me one thing, he said.
He is awfully keen on it.
He doesn’t ask me, but orders me to escape.
But of that later.
He’s simply set on it.
Don’t tell him I told you.
Don’t tell him, for anything.
After the trial you’ll decide of yourself.
There’s the superintendent shouting in the yard.
He’ll be here directly.
We are late; it’s irregular.
Embrace me quickly.
They embraced and kissed.
A mournful smile came on to his lips.
Have you asked him whether he believes it? asked Alyosha.
No, I haven’t.
I wanted to, but I couldn’t.
I hadn’t the courage.
But I saw it from his eyes.
His lips twitched, his eyes fastened upon Alyosha.
Hush! What do you mean? he faltered helplessly.
The whole truth, the whole, don’t lie! repeated Mitya.
Mitya’s whole face was lighted up with bliss.
Now you have given me new life.
Well, go! You’ve given me strength for to‐morrow.
Alyosha went out in tears.
Intense, infinite compassion overwhelmed him instantly.
There was a poignant ache in his torn heart.
Love Ivan!—he suddenly recalled Mitya’s words.
And he was going to Ivan.
He badly wanted to see Ivan all day.
There was light in the windows.
He suddenly stopped and resolved to go in.
So he was just coming from Katerina Ivanovna.
Ah, it’s only you, said Ivan dryly.
Well, good‐by! You are going to her? Yes.
I won’t sit down.
I won’t stay more than a minute.
passed between you ...
at the time of your first acquaintance ...
in that town.
Both yourself and him, he answered softly.
You don’t know me yet, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she said menacingly.
And I don’t know myself yet.
Women are often dishonorable, she snarled.
as though he were a reptile ...
I’ve been to see Smerdyakov....
It’s only you I believed! she continued, still addressing Ivan.
He gave her a sort of strained smile.
Alyosha started at her tone.
He had not suspected such familiar intimacy between them.
Well, that’s enough, anyway, Ivan cut short the conversation.
I am going.
I’ll come to‐morrow.
The doctor told me so.
Go, run after him....
She told you to catch me up, because I’m mad.
I know it all by heart, he added irritably.
I was looking at your face just now.
You look very ill, Ivan.
Ivan walked on without stopping.
Alyosha followed him.
No, I don’t.
I suppose there are all kinds of insanity.
Ivan paused for half a minute.
They were just under a lamp‐post.
Ivan recognized the handwriting at once.
The bits were scattered by the wind.
How do you mean, offering herself? exclaimed Alyosha.
As wanton women offer themselves, to be sure.
She is on the verge of insanity, too, perhaps....
I had hoped to hear something from you ...
that would save her.
You’ll hear nothing from me.
If she is a child I am not her nurse.
Be quiet, Alexey.
Don’t go on about her.
I am not even thinking about it.
They were silent again for a moment.
you mean Katerina Ivanovna? Yes.
Whether she’s to save Mitya or ruin him.
She’ll pray for light from above.
She can’t make up her mind for herself, you see.
She has not had time to decide yet.
She takes me for her nurse, too.
She wants me to sing lullabies to her.
Katerina Ivanovna loves you, brother, said Alyosha sadly.
Perhaps; but I am not very keen on her.
She is suffering.
Why do you ...
I know that you’ve given her hope.
Forgive me for speaking to you like this, he added.
I must wait till sentence is passed on the murderer.
That’s impossible! cried Alyosha.
Why is it impossible? I’ve read it myself.
There can’t be such a document! Alyosha repeated warmly.
There can’t be, because he’s not the murderer.
It’s not he murdered father, not he! Ivan suddenly stopped.
There was even a supercilious note in his voice.
You know who, Alyosha pronounced in a low, penetrating voice.
You know who, broke helplessly from him.
He could scarcely breathe.
Who? Who? Ivan cried almost fiercely.
All his restraint suddenly vanished.
The silence lasted for half a minute.
I know I didn’t.
Are you raving? said Ivan, with a pale, distorted smile.
His eyes were riveted on Alyosha.
They were standing again under a lamp‐post.
You’ve told yourself several times that you are the murderer.
When did I say so? I was in Moscow....
When have I said so? Ivan faltered helplessly.
They were both silent.
The silence lasted a whole long minute.
They were both standing still, gazing into each other’s eyes.
They were both pale.
Suddenly Ivan began trembling all over, and clutched Alyosha’s shoulder.
You’ve been in my room! he whispered hoarsely.
You’ve been there at night, when he came....
Not him, damn the monster! Ivan shouted, in a frenzy.
Yes, you do know ...
or how could you—? It’s impossible that you don’t know.
Suddenly he seemed to check himself.
He stood still and seemed to reflect.
A strange grin contorted his lips.
I tell you once and for all, it’s not you.
But by now Ivan had apparently regained his self‐control.
I beg you to leave me at this turning.
It’s the way to your lodgings, too.
Then he turned and walked slowly homewards.
Ivan lived some distance from him.
He felt that he was trembling all over with anger.
And he had scarcely heard anything of him.
He found his brother agitated, nervously excited.
Mitya had been talkative, but very absent‐minded and incoherent.
He used violent language, accused Smerdyakov, and was fearfully muddled.
Many things seemed to him puzzling and suspicious.
Smerdyakov was lying on a truckle‐bed in a separate ward.
So at least Ivan fancied.
But that was only momentary.
It’s always worth while speaking to a clever man.
Ivan was reminded of that at once.
He sat down on the stool at his feet.
He remained dumb, and did not even look much interested.
Can you talk to me? asked Ivan.
I won’t tire you much.
Certainly I can, mumbled Smerdyakov, in a faint voice.
I only arrived to‐day....
To see the mess you are in here.
Smerdyakov was stolidly silent for a while.
How could I help knowing? It was clear beforehand.
You mentioned the very spot.
Ivan felt suddenly angry.
No, I haven’t yet, but I certainly shall.
I’ve inquired; don’t try and take me in.
You can’t foretell the day and the hour.
and so I went flying.
And the doctor here, Mr.
It was just then that the fit seized me.
Only I wanted to spare myself even more.
If I’d guessed, I should have stayed, cried Ivan.
A trace of color came into his face.
For it was nearer, anyway.
You didn’t understand it.
Damn you! Ivan swore again.
Ivan wondered inwardly again.
But I was prepared for any wickedness from you.
You told me yourself you could sham a fit.
And I only said so then to boast to you.
It was just foolishness.
My brother directly accuses you of the murder and theft.
Now I am going, but I’ll come again.
Good people visit me every day.
I quite understand.
It was the details that were so damning.
He could not think of Dmitri without repulsion.
Only one thing was strange, however.
This, too, struck Ivan particularly.
Many causes helped to bring about this feeling.
She was hurt, insulted and humiliated in her feelings.
But of all this later.
In the corner there was a case of ikons.
But Smerdyakov had finished tea and the samovar was out.
He was sitting at the table on a bench.
Take off your coat, Smerdyakov conceded.
Smerdyakov managed to sit down on his bench before him.
You’ve seen for yourself: there’s a passage.
He stared impudently at Ivan.
A mist passed before Ivan’s eyes for the first moment.
In an instant his face was bathed in tears.
A minute passed.
That’s enough! Leave off, Ivan said peremptorily, sitting down again.
Don’t put me out of all patience.
Smerdyakov took the rag from his eyes.
It was you murdered him? he cried suddenly.
Smerdyakov smiled contemptuously.
Look here, you didn’t say that a fortnight ago.
Ivan restrained himself with painful effort.
Very good, he commented at last.
There’s not a doubt you did reckon on Dmitri Fyodorovitch.
at the time....
No, I swear I didn’t! shouted Ivan, grinding his teeth.
I couldn’t have taken you to the lock‐up just then.
oh, I’m sorry I didn’t think of it.
Smerdyakov looked at him almost with relish.
Ivan’s eyes flashed and he trembled all over.
I’ll unmask you.
You hit the mark, indeed.
And you’d better be sensible.
The cool evening air refreshed him.
There was a bright moon in the sky.
A nightmare of ideas and sensations filled his soul.
On the contrary, he’ll accuse me.
He was like a madman.
Whether I did, I don’t know yet.
Then, parting from Alyosha, Mitya had rushed to Grushenka.
One string is left, and it vibrates.
The cur keeps it under his mattress, in pink ribbon.
I am not a thief, but I’ll murder my thief.
Katya, don’t look disdainful.
And he doesn’t love you.
When Ivan read this document he was convinced.
So then it was his brother, not Smerdyakov.
And if not Smerdyakov, then not he, Ivan.
Ivan was completely reassured.
He resolved to dismiss him with contempt and forget him.
So passed a month.
They were like two enemies in love with one another.
He determined to sacrifice thirty thousand on arranging Mitya’s escape.
His pride above all suffered cruelly all that month.
But of that later....
He felt that his hands were twitching convulsively.
He uttered one plaintive O—oh! and then was silent.
Ivan stepped up to him.
He was lying on his back, without movement or consciousness.
Why, does he make a row? asked Ivan coarsely.
Oh, dear, no, quite the contrary, he’s very quiet.
Ivan opened the door and stepped into the room.
Smerdyakov was sitting on the sofa, wearing the same dressing‐gown.
He seemed to be sitting doing nothing.
Why, you really are ill? Ivan stopped short.
What’s the matter with you? cried Ivan.
What do you mean by ‘nothing’? Yes, she has.
It’s no matter to you.
Let me alone.
No, I won’t let you alone.
Never mind my health, tell me what I ask you.
Damn it! I’ve nothing to do with you.
Just answer my question and I’ll go away.
I don’t understand you....
Smerdyakov measured him with his eyes.
You don’t understand? he drawled reproachfully.
I tell you, you’ve nothing to be afraid of.
He remembered Alyosha.
I know it was not I, he faltered.
Do you? Smerdyakov caught him up again.
Ivan jumped up and seized him by the shoulder.
He only riveted his eyes on Ivan with insane hatred.
Ivan sank back on his chair, as though pondering something.
He laughed malignantly.
You mean my going away.
All I understand is that you are mad.
_Did_ it? Why, did you murder him? Ivan turned cold.
Ivan still gazed at him, and seemed unable to speak.
No doubt he is here, that third, between us.
That third is God Himself—Providence.
He is the third beside us now.
Only don’t look for Him, you won’t find Him.
It’s a lie that you killed him! Ivan cried madly.
He was wearing long white stockings and slippers.
Smerdyakov pulled it out and laid it on the table.
Here, he said quietly.
What is it? asked Ivan, trembling.
Under the wrapper were three packets of hundred‐rouble notes.
Take them, Smerdyakov suggested to Ivan, nodding at the notes.
Ivan sank back in his chair.
He was as white as a handkerchief.
You frightened me ...
with your stocking, he said, with a strange grin.
No, I did not know.
I kept thinking of Dmitri.
All right, all right.
Talk about me later.
Why do I keep on trembling? I can’t speak properly.
You were bold enough then.
It’s very refreshing.
Only I must hide this first.
And again he motioned at the notes.
Ivan read it mechanically.
I won’t have any lemonade, he said.
Talk of me later.
Sit down and tell me how you did it.
Tell me all about it.
Speak, please, speak.
He seemed calmer.
How it was done? sighed Smerdyakov.
Only tell me in detail how you did it.
Everything, as it happened.
Don’t forget anything.
The details, above everything, the details, I beg you.
You’d gone away, then I fell into the cellar.
I shammed it all.
For two days I was quite unconscious.
All right, all right.
They laid me on the bed.
At night I moaned, but quietly.
I kept expecting Dmitri Fyodorovitch to come.
Expecting him? To come to you? Not to me.
And if he hadn’t come? Then nothing would have happened.
I should never have brought myself to it without him.
All right, all right ...
during the last few days....
He knew about the knocks, that was the chief thing.
That was inevitable, so I was expecting him.
But he would never have found the money.
But that wasn’t true.
It had been lying in a box.
But all believe it was under the mattress.
A stupid thing to believe.
I could reckon upon that.
I am getting mixed.
You are the rightful murderer.
If you had stayed, nothing would have happened.
Was I then so eager, was I? Ivan snarled again.
Smerdyakov looked resolutely at Ivan.
He evidently had some design.
Ivan felt that.
Go on, he said.
Tell me what happened that night.
I got up at last, went out.
‘Ech!’ I thought.
‘He’s killed Grigory!’ ‘Where?’ I whispered.
‘There, in the corner,’ he pointed.
He was whispering, too.
‘Wait a bit,’ I said.
The only risk was that Marfa Ignatyevna might wake up.
‘Where is she?’ he fairly gasped, but couldn’t believe it.
‘She’s standing there,’ said I.
‘Why, he is afraid of me now,’ I thought.
And it was funny.
He opened it.
‘Why, here she is,’ said I.
He didn’t even cry out.
And the third time I knew I’d broken his skull.
I looked round.
There was no blood on me, not a spot.
And there it stayed for over a fortnight.
The perspiration stood out on his face.
Stay, cried Ivan, pondering.
I keep forgetting and getting mixed up.
but why, I can’t understand....
I did that for a good reason.
But it’d be quite different with Dmitri Fyodorovitch.
Prosecutor’s mouth positively watered at my suggestion.
He looked at Smerdyakov again with alarm.
well, it was the devil helped you! Ivan cried again.
He got up, obviously intending to walk across the room.
He was in terrible distress.
I’m determined to! I shall tell everything, everything.
But we’ll make our appearance together.
You are ill, I see; you are quite ill.
We’ll go together, Ivan repeated.
And if you won’t go, no matter, I’ll go alone.
Smerdyakov paused as though pondering.
You don’t understand me, Ivan exclaimed reproachfully.
You’ll be too much ashamed, if you confess it all.
Take that money away with you, Smerdyakov sighed.
Of course, I shall take it.
You were right there.
So that’s how I looked at it.
With your guidance.
Then why are you giving it back? Leave off ...
that’s enough! Smerdyakov waved his hand again.
You’ll see, said Ivan.
It isn’t possible.
You are very clever.
You are fond of money, I know that.
You are not a fool, said Ivan, seeming struck.
The blood rushed to his face.
Take the money.
I shall show them at the court to‐morrow, he said.
Ivan rose from his seat.
Stay a moment....
Show me those notes again.
Ivan took out the notes and showed them to him.
Smerdyakov looked at them for ten seconds.
Ivan Fyodorovitch! he called after him again.
What do you want? Ivan turned without stopping.
The snowstorm was still raging.
It’s something physical, he thought with a grin.
Something like joy was springing up in his heart.
The snow had almost covered his face.
Ivan seized him and lifted him in his arms.
The man got ready and came out.
His mind wandered and worked incessantly.
He decided the question by turning back to the house.
He sank wearily on his sofa.
He sat on the sofa and felt giddy.
He felt that he was ill and helpless.
This happened several times.
At last his eyes were fastened intently on one point.
Ivan smiled, but an angry flush suffused his face.
Ivan was angrily silent and would not begin the conversation.
All at once his face expressed a sudden solicitude.
Yes, I’d forgotten ...
Look at the spiritualists, for instance....
I am very fond of them ...
I seem to be delirious....
But I feel somehow ashamed....
I want to walk about the room....
and in the top of my head ...
only please don’t talk philosophy, as you did last time.
If you can’t take yourself off, talk of something amusing.
I’ll get the better of you.
Yes, I am in my natural shape.
You are my hallucination.
Yes, that was a moment of weakness ...
but I couldn’t believe in you.
You scold me, but you laugh—that’s a good sign.
You just say what I am thinking ...
You are stupid and vulgar.
You are awfully stupid.
I am poor, but ...
I won’t say very honest, but ...
I like dreaming.
Besides, on earth I become superstitious.
Then there would be an end to my sufferings.
I subscribed ten roubles in the cause of the Slavs!...
But you are not listening.
But you are clever, anyway.
You are scolding again? I didn’t ask out of sympathy.
You needn’t answer.
Now rheumatism has come in again— Fool! repeated Ivan.
Satan _sum et nihil humanum a me alienum puto_.
What, what, Satan _sum et nihil humanum_ ...
But you didn’t get that from me.
Ivan stopped suddenly, seeming struck.
That never entered my head, that’s strange.
The subject is a complete enigma.
It was evidently of no use.
if only there could be an ax there.
An ax? the guest interrupted in surprise.
You are stupid, awfully stupid, said Ivan peevishly.
Fib more cleverly or I won’t listen.
In despair I wrote to Count Mattei in Milan.
So it wasn’t printed.
Philosophical reflections again? Ivan snarled malignantly.
I am a slandered man.
You upbraid me every moment with being stupid.
One can see you are young.
If everything in the universe were sensible, nothing would happen.
They suffer, of course ...
I am x in an indeterminate equation.
You’d better tell me some anecdote! said Ivan miserably.
This legend is about Paradise.
He was astounded and indignant.
‘This is against my principles!’ he said.
And he was punished for that ...
What tortures? Ah, don’t ask.
Now he was listening with an unexpected curiosity.
The Russian temperament.
I repeat, it’s a legend.
I give it for what it’s worth.
I thought I’d forgotten it ...
it’s come back to me in a dream.
Homeopathic doses perhaps are the strongest.
Not for one minute, cried Ivan furiously.
Aha! There’s an admission! But I am good‐natured.
I’ll come to your assistance again.
Listen, it was I caught you, not you me.
You are lying.
It’s the new method.
I know you.
We have our system of reckoning, you know.
I was present, it was simply charming.
My dear friend, I only wanted to amuse you.
I was by his side till the very last moment.
Here’s another incident that happened only the other day.
She bends down and whispers her sin into the grating.
I am bored with you, agonizingly and insufferably.
you know how susceptible and esthetically impressionable I am.
I, too, shall walk my quadrillion and learn the secret.
And there’s no knowing which will turn out the better....
Are you asleep? I might well be, Ivan groaned angrily.
And the _Geological Cataclysm_.
I came to treat myself to that pleasure.
It’s that, that we must begin with.
and so on and so on in the same style.
The voice continued.
In that sense, ‘all things are lawful’ for him.
There is no law for God.
Where God stands, the place is holy.
He can’t bring himself to swindle without a moral sanction.
A loud, persistent knocking was suddenly heard at the window.
Ivan jumped up from the sofa.
Open, open to him.
There’s a snowstorm and he is your brother.
The knocking continued.
The knocking at the window grew louder and louder.
He looked round him wildly.
He rushed to the window and opened the movable pane.
Brother, he cried suddenly, you must be terribly ill.
I knew he had hanged himself.
From whom? I don’t know.
But I knew.
Did I know? Yes, he told me.
He told me so just now.
Who is _he_? asked Alyosha, involuntarily looking round.
He’s slipped away.
Ivan raised his head and smiled softly.
He was afraid of you, of a dove like you.
You are a ‘pure cherub.’ Dmitri calls you a cherub.
the thunderous rapture of the seraphim.
What are seraphim? Perhaps a whole constellation.
But perhaps that constellation is only a chemical molecule.
There’s a constellation of the Lion and the Sun.
Give me the towel: it’s here on the chair.
I just threw it down there.
It’s not here.
Don’t worry yourself.
How is it it’s dry? There was no other.
You put that towel on your head? asked Alyosha.
No, no, no! Ivan cried suddenly.
It was not a dream.
He was here; he was sitting here, on that sofa.
Wait a minute.
It has happened before.
I have dreams now, Alyosha ...
yet they are not dreams, but reality.
I walk about, talk and see ...
though I am asleep.
But he was sitting here, on that sofa there....
He is frightfully stupid, Alyosha, frightfully stupid.
Ivan laughed suddenly and began pacing about the room.
The devil! He’s taken to visiting me.
He’s been here twice, almost three times.
But he is not Satan: that’s a lie.
He is an impostor.
He is simply a devil—a paltry, trivial devil.
He goes to the baths.
Alyosha, you are cold.
You’ve been in the snow.
He sat down beside him.
(He was becoming very talkative.) I like Lise.
I said something nasty about her.
It was a lie.
I like her ...
I am afraid for Katya to‐morrow.
I am more afraid of her than of anything.
On account of the future.
To‐morrow the cross, but not the gallows.
No, I shan’t hang myself.
Do you know, I can never commit suicide, Alyosha.
Yes, on that sofa in the corner.
You would have driven him away.
You did drive him away: he disappeared when you arrived.
I love your face, Alyosha.
All that’s base in me, all that’s mean and contemptible.
Yes, I am a romantic.
He guessed it ...
though it’s a libel.
He is frightfully stupid; but it’s to his advantage.
He has cunning, animal cunning—he knew how to infuriate me.
He fooled me like a boy.
I should never have owned it to myself.
He’s been teasing me.
And you know he does it so cleverly, so cleverly.
‘Conscience! What is conscience? I make it up for myself.
Why am I tormented by it? From habit.
He laughed at me.
He told lies about me to my face.
It was not you murdered him.
No, he knows what he says.
‘You are going from pride,’ he says.
Brother, calm yourself, stop! Alyosha entreated him.
Yes, he knows how to torment one.
He’s cruel, Ivan went on, unheeding.
What are you going for now?’ That’s awful, Alyosha.
I can’t endure such questions.
You’ll sit all night deliberating whether to go or not.
But you will go; you know you’ll go.
You’ll go because you won’t dare not to go.
Why won’t you dare? You must guess that for yourself.
You came and he went.
He must be killed! Katya despises me.
I’ve seen that for a month past.
Alyosha recalled what he had just said.
I seem to be sleeping awake....
I walk, I speak, I see, but I am asleep.
It seemed to be just like that now.
Alyosha did not leave him.
By degrees Ivan lost consciousness completely at last.
Ivan let him lead him to his bed.
Alyosha undressed him somehow and put him to bed.
He sat watching over him for another two hours.
As he fell asleep he prayed for Mitya and Ivan.
He began to understand Ivan’s illness.
The anguish of a proud determination.
Alyosha smiled softly.
God will conquer! he thought.
But I see I shall do better not to apologize.
This became evident at the trial this day.
Among them were lawyers, ladies, and even several distinguished personages.
Every ticket of admission had been snatched up.
A large proportion—not less than half of the public—were ladies.
Their faces betrayed hysterical, intense, almost morbid, curiosity.
One of them—Katerina Ivanovna—was an object of general interest.
In brief, there was a great deal of talk.
There were numbers of severe, frowning, even vindictive faces.
But these rumors were not quite just.
People laughed particularly at his passion for psychology.
He was, too, a man of connections and property.
The prosecutor, of course, entered immediately after.
I don’t quite remember how he described him.
There was a hush through the court.
One could have heard a fly.
He looked an awful dandy in a brand‐new frock‐coat.
He wore immaculate black kid gloves and exquisite linen.
He looked about forty.
In fact, there was something strikingly birdlike about his face.
He was in evening dress and white tie.
It was a long list.
What struck people most was Mitya’s sudden outburst.
It escaped me.
I won’t do it again.
His character was displayed, and it spoke for itself.
It was rather short, but circumstantial.
Yet it made a great impression on me.
The clerk read it loudly and distinctly.
Dmitri Karamazov is a scoundrel, but not a thief.
He sat down again, visibly trembling all over.
Then he ordered the case to proceed.
All the witnesses were led up to take the oath.
Then I saw them all together.
Then they began calling them up one by one.
But no doubt it was so.
His confidence and self‐reliance were unmistakable, however.
It was impossible to make him contradict himself.
The family picture stood out in lurid colors.
And pepper perhaps? Fetyukovitch queried.
Yes, there was pepper, too.
And all dissolved in vodka? In spirit.
There was a faint sound of laughter in the court.
You see, in spirit.
A tumbler‐full, even.
Perhaps a tumbler and a half? Grigory did not answer.
He seemed to see what was meant.
There was another laugh in the court.
The President made a movement.
That’s not a proof that you were awake.
But before Grigory left the box another episode occurred.
Prisoner, be careful in your language, the President admonished him.
I am not a poodle, Grigory muttered.
All right, it’s I am a poodle myself, cried Mitya.
I was a beast and cruel to him.
I was cruel to Æsop too.
What Æsop? the President asked sternly again.
Oh, Pierrot ...
my father, Fyodor Pavlovitch.
You are injuring yourself in the opinion of your judges.
He was, in fact, allowed some latitude of speech.
(It must be noted that Grushenka’s surname was Svyetlov.
I am a young man ...
I only wanted to know ...
I took it for a joke ...
meaning to give it back later....
Of course I shall give it back.
God bless him.
Ilusha told me not to.
God will make it up to me yonder.
Now he is dying....
Karamazov? Trifon Borissovitch shuffled in vain....
The same thing happened with the Poles.
But Fetyukovitch caught them, too, in his snares.
The two latter appeared also as witnesses for the prosecution.
He was a kind‐hearted and humane man.
He laughed unexpectedly when there was nothing to laugh at.
The doctor expressed his opinion positively and emphatically.
The young doctor concluded his modest testimony with some heat.
The old man was fond of making jokes.
Oh, yes, that’s what I say, he went on stubbornly.
Where did they go? I’ve forgotten the word.
Wandering? Oh, yes, wandering, that’s what I say.
And yet he was a grateful and sensitive boy.
Oh, yes, I was a young man then....
I was ...
a pound of what? I’ve forgotten what it’s called.
Apples? Oh, no, no.
You have a dozen of apples, not a pound....
No, there are a lot of them, and all little.
You put them in the mouth and crack.
Nuts? Quite so, nuts, I say so.
Twenty‐ three years passed.
And I shed tears.
He laughed, but he shed tears, too ...
But he did weep; I saw it.
And now, alas!...
He did not tell me so directly, answered Alyosha.
at a moment of fury, he might perhaps murder him.
I made no accusation against Smerdyakov of myself.
I know he wouldn’t lie to me.
I saw from his face he wasn’t lying.
The prosecutor dropped the examination at this point.
But Fetyukovitch began his cross‐examination.
I remember one circumstance now which I’d quite forgotten myself.
I remember its seeming stupid ...
it flashed through my mind.
That’s what brought it back to me just now.
The prosecutor, of course, intervened.
I might have repaid it and didn’t repay it.
Alyosha was glad.
As she entered something extraordinary happened in the court.
The ladies clutched their lorgnettes and opera‐glasses.
All in black, she advanced modestly, almost timidly.
she added quietly.
I will only give the substance of her evidence.
I have never doubted his disinterestedness and his honesty ...
his scrupulous honesty ...
in money matters.
He certainly never uttered any such threat before me.
and I myself was put in such a position ...
that I could not invite him....
There was a note of defiance in her voice.
It was then Fetyukovitch began his cross‐examination.
No, I can never forget those moments.
She began telling her story.
to beg him for the money.
The court was hushed, trying to catch each word.
It was something unexampled.
It was hinted that something was here omitted.
Fetyukovitch made a low bow to her.
Oh, he was almost triumphant! Much ground had been gained.
The case was thrown into quite a different light.
There was a wave of sympathy for Mitya.
As for him....
She was pale and sat with her eyes cast down.
Grushenka was called.
But of that later.
A few words first about Grushenka.
She was proud and could not stand contempt.
It was all on account of me it happened.
Samsonov’s name came up somehow.
Grushenka crimsoned and her eyes flashed.
But that was all foolishness.
I was only laughing.
I wouldn’t have gone to him for anything.
Dmitri Fyodorovitch told me so himself; you can believe him.
She was again asked to whom she was referring.
The young lady, Katerina Ivanovna there.
He is not the man to tell a lie.
Fetyukovitch began his cross‐examination.
What led you to be so liberal to Mr.
Why, he is my cousin.
His mother was my mother’s sister.
Fetyukovitch was satisfied: it was another godsend.
Mitya was silent throughout her evidence.
Ivan was called to give evidence.
His entrance was for the first moment almost unnoticed.
Time was passing.
Well, and what else? he asked in a loud voice.
The President showed signs of uneasiness.
I have nothing particular.
They began asking him questions.
To many questions he answered that he did not know.
He knew nothing of his father’s money relations with Dmitri.
I wasn’t interested in the subject, he added.
I have nothing particular to tell the court.
I am like the peasant girl, your excellency ...
It’s in some book about the peasantry.
What do you mean by that? the President asked severely.
Why, this, Ivan suddenly pulled out a roll of notes.
Here’s the money ...
Where shall I put them? Mr.
Superintendent, take them.
I got them from Smerdyakov, from the murderer, yesterday....
I was with him just before he hanged himself.
It was he, not my brother, killed our father.
I should think I am in my right mind ...
in the same nasty mind as all of you ...
as all these ...
He turned suddenly to the audience.
They keep up the sham with one another.
Liars! They all desire the death of their fathers.
One reptile devours another....
It’s a spectacle they want! _Panem et circenses_.
The usher at once approached him.
Alyosha jumped up and cried, He is ill.
Don’t believe him: he has brain fever.
Don’t disturb yourselves.
The prosecutor bent over to the President in obvious dismay.
The two other judges communicated in agitated whispers.
The President seemed suddenly to recollect himself.
Witness, your words are incomprehensible and impossible here.
Calm yourself, if you can, and tell your story ...
if you really have something to tell.
How can you confirm your statement ...
if indeed you are not delirious? That’s just it.
I have no proof.
in an envelope.
You think of nothing but envelopes—one is enough.
I’ve no witnesses ...
except one, perhaps, he smiled thoughtfully.
He ceased laughing and spoke as it were, confidentially.
idiocy! Come, release the monster ...
he’s been singing a hymn.
Why, why is everything so stupid?...
But the court was all excitement by now.
He screamed furiously.
The whole court was thrown into confusion.
I don’t remember everything as it happened.
I was excited myself and could not follow.
Katerina Ivanovna had an attack of hysterics.
at once! Here is a document, a letter ...
that man there, there! she pointed to Mitya.
It was, I repeat, difficult to notice every detail.
What followed is still confused to my mind.
I only remember how they began examining the witness.
and because he owed me that three thousand....
I beg you, I beseech you, to hear me.
Yes, yes—to win that creature and carry her off.
I give it to you myself.
He wanted to repay it me.
He was drunk when he wrote it.
I saw it at once, at the time.
A complete program of it! she exclaimed frantically.
Now she had taken the fatal plunge.
It made an overwhelming impression.
They asked Mitya whether he admitted having written the letter.
It’s mine, mine! cried Mitya.
I shouldn’t have written it, if I hadn’t been drunk!...
I was telling lies just now.
I saw that....
He had been twice to see Smerdyakov.
I saw his mind was giving way.
She betrayed Mitya, but she betrayed herself, too.
She was carried out.
She wouldn’t allow it.
She fought and struggled to get back to Mitya.
Mitya uttered a cry and struggled to get to her.
He was overpowered.
Then I remember the Moscow doctor appeared on the scene.
Having given his evidence, the celebrated doctor withdrew.
Fetyukovitch was obviously shaken by Katerina Ivanovna’s evidence.
But the prosecutor was triumphant.
The Prosecutor’s Speech.
He described this himself afterwards.
Where his speech really excelled was in its sincerity.
But as soon as he had finished, he almost fainted.
Look at our vice, at our profligates.
And yet we all knew him, ‘he lived among us!’...
At this point Ippolit Kirillovitch’s speech was interrupted by applause.
The liberal significance of this simile was appreciated.
He had no feelings for his duties as a father.
He ridiculed those duties.
The old man’s maxim was _Après moi le déluge_.
Of the other two I will speak only cursorily.
He has denied and rejected much already, like his father.
Then the third son.
But I don’t know whether it was true.
He is the prisoner before us.
There he led a wild life as an officer.
Honor, self‐sacrifice were shown there, and I will be silent.
Nothing could be more inconceivable.
But we shall return to that later.
That was the beginning of the passion.
We have good evidence of this.
It was in that position that he was arrested.
She became prudent and saved money.
The prisoner does not deny his signature.
Afterwards he talked less about it.
He described his visit to Samsonov, his journey to Lyagavy.
He accompanied her himself to her protector.
But of that later.
Madame Svyetlov was even more astounding.
‘He suspected me at every instant.
I wrote them down and I remember them.
But that’s perfectly intelligible.
So the doctors tell us.
Two persons are left—the prisoner and Smerdyakov.
I will waive that point however.
‘He did it alone,’ he says.
‘He murdered and robbed him.
But he was far from distorting or minimizing them.
I have money.
Any other feeling, any other motive would be unnatural.
The Galloping Troika.
The End Of The Prosecutor’s Speech.
Possibly he regarded him as a fiction.
Grasping this instantly, he resigned himself.
That way out was suicide.
Oh, now he needed money more than ever.
But now the turning comes to the next street.
And so to the very end, to the very scaffold.
This I imagine is how it was with Karamazov then.
With what object? I shall be asked.
And this was what we all witnessed then.
‘Blood! I’ve deserved it!’ But he quickly restrained himself.
We proceeded to search him.
The effect of it was amazing.
Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to his final peroration.
Do not disappoint Russia and her expectations.
From horror, perhaps from disgust.
I remember some of them.
A weighty speech, a gentleman in one group observed gravely.
He brought in too much psychology, said another voice.
He summed it all up.
Yes, he summed us up, too, chimed in another voice.
But that was all rot.
And obscure too.
He was a little too much carried away.
It’s unjust, it’s unjust.
No, it was smartly done, anyway.
He was in too great a hurry.
He is a nervous man.
That’s why she has the lorgnette.
She is not good for much.
Oh, no, she is a piquante little woman.
And there was too much rhetoric, such long sentences.
He is afraid of them.
Yes, and he is afraid of the lawyer, too.
Ippolit was thinking of him, I know he was.
He was talking about that last week.
Not an easy job.
Where would they get it? In America.
They get it from America now.
Nonsense! But the bell rang, all rushed to their places.
Fetyukovitch mounted the tribune.
The Speech For The Defense.
The eyes of the audience were fastened upon him.
So Fetyukovitch began.
I have no preconceived ideas.
The prisoner is of turbulent and violent temper.
Outraged morality, and still more outraged taste, is often relentless.
Here we have a different psychology.
It all depends on who makes use of it.
I am speaking of the abuse of psychology, gentlemen.
There Was No Money.
Gentlemen of the jury, he began.
Madame Svyetlov, too, had been told of it.
Yet no one had ever seen these notes.
The prosecutor is charmed with his own romance.
So be it.
That was more important than carousing.
That’s a fact that can’t be disputed.
He was there, so he must have.
But examine all these facts separately, regardless of their connection.
But again I ask, Mr.
He would have killed himself, that’s certain.
Then Smerdyakov’s sudden suicide on the eve of the trial.
There is something unexplained, incomplete.
And perhaps it may one day be explained.
But we won’t go into that now.
Of that later.
There was no simplicity about him, either.
The prosecutor was too simple in taking him for weak‐minded.
He cursed and jeered at Russia.
He dreamed of going to France and becoming a Frenchman.
They had everything, he nothing.
Moreover, he saw three thousand roubles in new rainbow‐colored notes.
But it is very easy to point out that moment.
His mind sets to work at once.
Oh, I am not contradicting myself—the money may have existed.
What’s more, it struck me at the time.
He insinuated it, as it were.
And that’s natural.
Despair and penitence are two very different things.
Even so, hear what I have to say.
To murder such a father—that’s inconceivable.
That’s the misfortune.
And indeed some fathers are a misfortune.
But I may say half a word.
Who has authorized me to preach to fathers? No one.
The court relapsed into silence at once.
The orator went on.
How shall it be decided? Why, like this.
The fathers and mothers present applauded.
Handkerchiefs were waved.
The President began ringing his bell with all his might.
What he wanted to know was where she was.
Such a murder is not a murder.
Such a murder is not a parricide.
Such a murder can only be reckoned parricide by prejudice.
They are wicked and I will be wicked.
The President submitted, and even postponed ringing his bell.
The orator himself was genuinely touched.
People looked at him with hatred.
But he soon recovered himself.
I am reproached with having woven a romance.
The audience, too, was uneasy.
The public was restless: there were even exclamations of indignation.
Then the prisoner was allowed to speak.
Mitya stood up, but said very little.
He was fearfully exhausted, physically and mentally.
His voice was weak, he did not shout as before.
I thank my counsel, too.
And don’t believe the doctors.
I am perfectly sane, only my heart is heavy.
I will be a better man.
But I will not describe the details.
At last the jury rose to retire for consultation.
The jury withdrew and the court adjourned.
An acquittal, they thought, was inevitable.
Fetyukovitch himself was confident of his success.
One feels during one’s speech if they are being formed.
I was aware of them.
Our cause is won.
Set your mind at rest.
But they are not all peasants.
There are four government clerks among them.
But he never speaks.
He is no great talker, but so much the better.
He’s the father of twelve children.
They’ll acquit him for certain, said a resolute voice.
But it was a pity they dragged the valet in.
Oh, but she did not finish cutting it.
That makes no difference.
She began cutting it.
She is at home with toothache.
I remember how the jurymen walked into the court.
Many of the men in the audience were pleased.
At first they could scarcely believe their ears.
Mitya was taken away.
The passing of the sentence was deferred till next day.
Well, our peasants have stood firm.
And have done for our Mitya.
Varvinsky and Herzenstube were attending him.
Alyosha came to see his sick brother twice a day.
They had been talking for a quarter of an hour.
He must escape.
You know he has already entered into negotiations....
I’ve told you something already....
Oh, it’s a long way off yet.
That was when—do you remember?—you found us quarreling.
Of course he did not tell you.
It was about that plan of escape.
That is how our first quarrel began.
no, I could not bear it, I should kill myself.
So he came to the court ...
But he dreaded that moment and longed to spare her.
He spoke of Mitya again.
You may be sure he will consent to escape.
Don’t be anxious; he will consent to run away.
She paused and smiled.
Brute! Yes, I am a brute.
I am responsible for his fever.
And yet it was she who had betrayed him.
He hoped that it was only at moments.
unchristian, perhaps? Katya added, even more defiantly.
I’ll tell him everything, muttered Alyosha.
Me? Can that be? she faltered, turning pale.
He needs you particularly just now.
So much has happened to him since that day.
He realizes that he has injured you beyond all reckoning.
It’s so sudden....
I knew he would ask me to come.
It’s impossible! Let it be impossible, but do it.
I ought to ...
but I cannot....
He will look at me....
Your eyes ought to meet.
But why to‐day, why at once?...
I can’t leave our patient— You can for a moment.
It will only be a moment.
Then you will come, said Alyosha firmly, seeing her tears.
I’ll go and tell him you will come directly.
I don’t know yet— Her voice failed her.
She gasped for breath.
Alyosha got up to go.
But only Alyosha and Grushenka had visited Mitya.
Alyosha sat down beside him on the bed in silence.
Alyosha understood his feelings.
Listen, began Alyosha.
She will come, but I don’t know when.
But she will come, she will, that’s certain.
Mitya started, would have said something, but was silent.
The news had a tremendous effect on him.
You’ve spoken of that already, Mitya observed musingly.
And you have repeated it to Grusha, observed Alyosha.
Yes, Mitya admitted.
She won’t come this morning.
He looked timidly at his brother.
She won’t come till the evening.
I did not dare to try her further.
Does she? broke from Alyosha.
Perhaps she does not.
You know, Ivan is superior to all of us.
He ought to live, not us.
He will recover.
That means that she is convinced he will die.
Yes, he will get well.
But she is convinced that he will die.
She has a great deal of sorrow to bear...
A silence followed.
A grave anxiety was fretting Mitya.
I’ve been lying here all night, passing judgment on myself.
For Grusha I would bear anything ...
anything except blows....
But she won’t be allowed to come there.
Alyosha smiled gently.
Listen, brother, once for all, he said.
This is what I think about it.
You wanted to make yourself another man by suffering.
Such heavy burdens are not for all men.
For some they are impossible.
I must tell you the truth.
And so I can’t judge of your own action.
Now I think I’ve gone into everything.
But I do condemn myself! cried Mitya.
Alyosha smiled gently.
So I’ve caught my Alyosha being Jesuitical.
I must kiss you for that.
This is what I planned and decided.
Even though Grusha will be with me.
I shall choke there! he exclaimed, his eyes suddenly flashing.
His voice was trembling with tears.
There must be some remote parts even there.
Work and grammar—that’s how we’ll spend three years.
Don’t be uneasy—we would not come to this little town.
I dare say they won’t recognize us.
And if they do, let them send us to Siberia.
I don’t care.
It will show it’s our fate.
But we shall die on our own soil.
That’s my plan, and it shan’t be altered.
Again there was silence for a minute.
Grusha keeps looking at me.
I am a scoundrel, that’s all one can say.
Here she is! cried Alyosha.
At that instant Katya appeared in the doorway.
Seeing it, she flew impetuously to him.
So passed two minutes.
She stopped to take breath.
Tears streamed from her eyes.
Know that you will always be so.
I shall love you, and ...
When you fell down and were carried out ...
when you gave evidence....
I’ve never believed it.
I hated you, and for a moment I persuaded myself.
Let me go, she whispered.
I’ll come again.
It’s more than I can bear now.
Grushenka walked suddenly and noiselessly into the room.
No one had expected her.
You won’t forgive her! cried Mitya, with frantic reproach.
She could not yet recover herself.
I don’t know ...
He overtook her outside the hospital grounds.
She would not forgive me....
He was sure she would not come— No doubt.
Let us leave that, she snapped.
Listen: I can’t go with you to the funeral now.
I’ve sent them flowers.
I think they still have money.
If necessary, tell them I’ll never abandon them....
Now leave me, leave me, please.
Leave me, please! Ilusha’s Funeral.
The Speech At The Stone He really was late.
It was the coffin of poor little Ilusha.
He had died two days after Mitya was sentenced.
Kolya Krassotkin was the foremost of them.
It’s awful here.
It’s really horrible to see it.
I am always manly, but this is awful.
The valet killed him, my brother is innocent, answered Alyosha.
That’s what I said, cried Smurov.
Of course ...
Alyosha went into the room.
Snegiryov’s face looked eager, yet bewildered and exasperated.
There in the churchyard the ground has been crossed.
He’ll be prayed for there.
They carried the coffin past her.
The old woman wept as she said it.
It was a still, clear day, with a slight frost.
The church bells were still ringing.
He seemed in a state of bewildered anxiety.
He instantly pulled it out and was reassured.
After the customary rites the grave‐ diggers lowered the coffin.
He did not seem to understand fully what was happening.
Come, fly down, birds, fly down, sparrows! he muttered anxiously.
The boys and Alyosha kept up with him.
Smurov picked it up and carried it after him.
He jumped up and ran homewards again.
Nina, too, broke into sobs.
Kolya ran out of the room, the boys followed him.
At last Alyosha too went out.
Let us wait a minute and then go back.
No, it’s no use, it’s awful, Kolya assented.
Ah, so would I, said Alyosha.
Perhaps he will.
The boy flushed crimson but did not dare to reply.
They all stood still by the big stone.
A sudden impulse seemed to come into his soul.
Boys, we shall soon part.
That’s only from thoughtlessness.
We will remember, we will remember, cried the boys.
Karamazov, we love you! a voice, probably Kartashov’s, cried impulsively.
There were tears in the eyes of many of them.
Hurrah for Karamazov! Kolya shouted ecstatically.
For ever! the boys chimed in again.
Ah, how splendid it will be! broke from Kolya.
Don’t peck at one another, children.
So I did, Beth.
Well, I think we are.
It’s so boyish! That’s why I do it.
Poor Jo! It’s too bad, but it can’t be helped.
But your absurd words are as bad as Jo’s slang.
They are quite worn out.
Marmee must have a new pair.
No, I shall! cried Amy.
That’s like you, dear! What will we get? exclaimed Jo.
Army shoes, best to be had, cried Jo.
Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed, said Beth.
I’ll get a little bottle of cologne.
How will we give the things? asked Meg.
We must go shopping tomorrow afternoon, Meg.
I don’t mean to act any more after this time.
We ought to rehearse tonight.
I can’t help it.
If I can go down easily, I’ll drop.
Do it this way.
Come on, Meg.
Not quite, replied Jo modestly.
I always wanted to do the killing part.
Come and kiss me, baby.
While making these maternal inquiries Mrs.
As they gathered about the table, Mrs.
Not for many months, dear, unless he is sick.
Now come and hear the letter.
Give them all of my dear love and a kiss.
Everybody sniffed when they came to that part.
We all will, cried Meg.
I rather think she hasn’t got any, said her mother.
Yes, I have.
Let us do it, said Meg thoughtfully.
We ought to have our roll of directions, like Christian.
It was uninteresting sewing, but tonight no one grumbled.
Then she opened her new book and began to read.
I’m glad mine is blue, said Amy.
Goodness only knows.
How funny! cried Jo, taking one up.
I thought you’d do it, said Mrs.
March, smiling as if satisfied.
They were soon ready, and the procession set out.
The big chamber was the scene of many innocent revels.
Waving a wand, it sang...
It was truly superb.
Zara replied and, after a musical dialogue, consented to fly.
Then came the grand effect of the play.
This dauntless example fired Zara.
Don Pedro refuses, because he is not rich.
This entirely softens the stern sire.
The excitement had hardly subsided when Hannah appeared, with Mrs.
March’s compliments, and would the ladies walk down to supper.
Is it fairies? asked Amy.
Santa Claus, said Beth.
Mother did it.
Laurence sent it, replied Mrs.
Hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party.
He is an odd old gentleman, but that pleased him.
My mother knows old Mr.
We invited him to our party, but he didn’t come.
But we’ll have another play sometime that he can see.
Perhaps he’ll help act.
They are lovely.
But Beth’s roses are sweeter to me, said Mrs.
March, smelling the half-dead posy in her belt.
As Meg appeared, Scrabble whisked into his hole.
If I only had a silk! sighed Meg.
The front is all right.
Gloves are more important than anything else.
Then I’ll stay still.
I don’t care much for company dancing.
It’s no fun to go sailing round.
I like to fly about and cut capers.
That’s all I can do.
Then I’ll go without.
It’s the dampness drying, replied Jo.
I always spoil everything.
It isn’t spoiled.
I’ve seen many girls do it so, said Amy consolingly.
Serves me right for trying to be fine.
I wish I’d let my hair alone, cried Meg petulantly.
So do I, it was so smooth and pretty.
Have a good time, dearies! said Mrs.
March, as the sisters went daintily down the walk.
Gardiner’s dressing room after a prolonged prink.
I know I shall forget.
No, winking isn’t ladylike.
It isn’t the thing.
Shan’t I disturb you? Not a bit.
So did I.
Don’t go away, please, unless you’d rather.
You live near us, don’t you? Next door.
Grandpa sent it.
Nicely, thank you, Mr.
I’m not Mr.
Laurence, I’m only Laurie.
Laurie Laurence, what an odd name.
And Jo resigned herself with a sigh.
Don’t you dance? Sometimes.
Abroad! cried Jo.
Don’t I wish I’d been there! cried Jo.
Did you go to Paris? We spent last winter there.
Do say some! I can read it, but can’t pronounce.
Not for a year or two.
I won’t go before seventeen, anyway.
Sixteen, next month.
I hate it! Nothing but grinding or skylarking.
I can’t, for I told Meg I wouldn’t, because...
You may laugh, if you want to.
It is funny, I know.
But Laurie didn’t laugh.
I’ll tell you how we can manage.
I’ve sprained my ankle.
I knew you’d hurt your feet with those silly shoes.
No, indeed! It’s past nine, and dark as Egypt.
I can’t stop here, for the house is full.
Sallie has some girls staying with her.
I’ll ask Laurie.
Mercy, no! Don’t ask or tell anyone.
They are going out to supper now.
I’ll stay with you.
No, dear, run along, and bring me some coffee.
I’m so tired I can’t stir.
Gardiner was taking a little private refreshment.
Can I help you? said a friendly voice.
Hush! Don’t say anything, she whispered, adding aloud, It’s nothing.
I had a capital time.
Yes, till I hurt myself.
Laurie and I couldn’t help laughing.
Did you hear us? No, but it was very rude.
And I think Jo was quite right.
Wouldn’t it be fun? answered Jo, yawning dismally.
Everyone seemed rather out of sorts and inclined to croak.
Jo would whistle and make a great racket getting ready.
March, crossing out the third spoiled sentence in her letter.
Cuddle your cats and get over your headache, Bethy.
We can’t give up our girls for a dozen fortunes.
Jo’s ambition was to do something very splendid.
One thing, however, rather quenched the vanities.
She had to wear her cousin’s clothes.
‘I don’t understand what it’s all about.
Did she own she liked it? asked Meg.
I heard Mrs.
King crying and Mr.
Well, she drew a picture of Mr.
When I went to get some oysters for Hannah, Mr.
Cutter the fish-man.
Laurence’s bed in heaven would be ‘aisy’.
‘Not a mite more than I ought, ma’am.
I’d go myself, if I was any use.
I like that kind of sermon.
We needed that lesson, and we won’t forget it.
I like adventures, and I’m going to find some.
A low hedge parted the two estates.
The plan of ‘going over’ was not forgotten.
She saw Mr.
Better, thank you.
What do you amuse yourself with? Nothing.
It’s dull as tombs up here.
Don’t you read? Not much.
They won’t let me.
Have someone come and see you then.
There isn’t anyone I’d like to see.
Boys make such a row, and my head is weak.
Don’t know any.
You know us, began Jo, then laughed and stopped.
So I do! Will you come, please? cried Laurie.
I’ll go ask her.
Here I am, bag and baggage, she said briskly.
Tell the girl to put it away for your tea.
It worries me though.
Now then, you’re fixed.
How kind you are! Yes, that’s what it wanted.
No, I came to amuse you.
Not a bit.
I’ll talk all day if you’ll only set me going.
Beth says I never know when to stop.
Yes, that’s Beth.
I haven’t got any mother, you know.
Never mind being bashful.
It won’t last long if you keep going.
Don’t go to school, I’m a businessman—girl, I mean.
Oh! That does me no end of good.
Don’t mind me.
I’m happy as a cricket here, answered Jo.
That answer pleased the old gentleman.
Only trying to be neighborly, sir.
And Jo told how her visit came about.
Tut, tut, tut! That was the boy’s affair.
How is the poor woman? Doing nicely, sir.
Just her father’s way of doing good.
I shall come and see your mother some fine day.
Tell her so.
Come down and go on being neighborly.
If you’d like to have me, sir.
Shouldn’t ask you, if I didn’t.
Laurence offered her his arm with old-fashioned courtesy.
That’s evident, by the way you racket downstairs.
Come to your tea, sir, and behave like a gentleman.
She’s right, the lad is lonely.
Laurence, as he looked and listened.
They found Mr.
Sometimes, he answered modestly.
Please do now.
I want to hear it, so I can tell Beth.
Won’t you first? Don’t know how.
Too stupid to learn, but I love music dearly.
That will do, that will do, young lady.
Too many sugarplums are not good for him.
My respects to your mother.
Good night, Doctor Jo.
He shook his head.
No, it was me.
He doesn’t like to hear me play.
Why not? I’ll tell you some day.
John is going home with you, as I can’t.
No need of that.
Mother, why didn’t Mr.
Dear me, how romantic! exclaimed Meg.
How silly! said Jo.
He meant the blanc mange, I suppose.
How stupid you are, child! He meant you, of course.
March is doing more for him than we can.
What good times they had, to be sure.
Laurence talked on about Laurie’s lessons and teachers.
But the piano suffers for want of use.
March could reply, Mr.
Laurence went on with an odd little nod and smile...
Not a soul, my dear.
I had a little girl once, with eyes like these.
God bless you, my dear! Good day, madam.
And away he went, in a great hurry.
She never knew that Mr.
At any rate she deserved both.
Mother, I’m going to work Mr.
Laurence a pair of slippers.
Beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense.
Just think, he’s given you her piano.
‘Your humble servant, James Laurence’.
Only think of his writing that to you.
I’ll tell the girls.
Try it, honey.
Yes, I mean to.
But he liked it.
Davis says, retorted Amy, finishing Jo with her Latin.
I need it so much.
Tell me all about it.
If one girl likes another, she gives her a lime.
Don’t you like limes? Not much.
You may have my share.
Here’s the money.
Miss March, come to the desk.
Don’t take all.
Is that all? Not quite, stammered Amy.
Bring the rest immediately.
With a despairing glance at her set, she obeyed.
So I see.
This—this was too much.
As Amy returned from her last trip, Mr.
Miss March, hold out your hand.
That was dreadful.
You can go, Miss March, said Mr.
Davis, looking, as he felt, uncomfortable.
Davis was quite benignant in the afternoon, also unusually nervous.
March that evening.
I don’t approve of corporal punishment, especially for girls.
I dislike Mr.
I wish I’d known that nice girl.
And he isn’t conceited, is he? asked Amy.
Not in the least.
Little girls shouldn’t ask questions, returned Jo sharply.
You are going somewhere with Laurie, I know you are.
Aren’t you going with him? Yes, we are.
Now do be still, and stop bothering.
Please let me.
Suppose we take her.
Fiddlesticks! returned Jo, slamming the door.
at once, and looked surprised.
Amy poked the fire and said nothing.
Amy, you’ve got it! No, I haven’t.
You know where it is, then! No, I don’t.
And Jo gave her a slight shake.
Why not? I burned it up.
The storm cleared up below, for Mrs.
Please forgive me, Jo.
I’m very, very sorry.
No one spoke of the great trouble, not even Mrs.
As Jo received her good-night kiss, Mrs.
Forgive each other, help each other, and begin again tomorrow.
Everybody is so hateful, I’ll ask Laurie to go skating.
Don’t say that.
Go after them.
Jo saw her coming, and turned her back.
As Laurie turned the bend, he shouted back...
Keep near the shore.
It isn’t safe in the middle.
She tried to call Laurie, but her voice was gone.
Something rushed swiftly by her, and Laurie’s voice cried out...
Bring a rail.
When Amy was comfortably asleep, the house quiet, and Mrs.
Quite safe, dear.
Laurie did it all.
I only let her go.
Mother, if she should die, it would be my fault.
Tell me how you do it, Marmee dear.
My good mother used to help me...
As you do us...
interrupted Jo, with a grateful kiss.
Poor Mother! What helped you then? Your father, Jo.
You have had a warning.
I will try, Mother, I truly will.
Was he reminding you then? asked Jo softly.
I thought I’d grieved you.
I let the sun go down on my anger.
Change it, advised Jo.
You are a dear to lend me yours, Jo.
And Meg took a refreshing peep at her glove box.
Annie Moffat has blue and pink bows on her nightcaps.
Poor folks shouldn’t rig, said Jo decidedly.
They are for Miss March, the man said.
Everyone was very kind, and she had three compliments.
The girl evidently doesn’t think of it yet, said Mrs.
Daisy, dear, I’ve sent an invitation to your friend, Mr.
Laurence, for Thursday.
Why not, Cherie? asked Miss Belle.
He’s too old.
There isn’t any, Laurie is only a little boy.
About your age, Nan said.
My mother and old Mr.
Can I do anything for you, young ladies? asked Mrs.
Moffat, lumbering in like an elephant in silk and lace.
No, thank you, ma’am, replied Sallie.
What shall you wear? asked Sallie.
I haven’t got any other.
Not at all.
She heard Mrs.
Moffat reply to one of them...
Silly creatures, to put such thoughts into my head.
I’m glad you came, I was afraid you wouldn’t.
she said, with her most grown-up air.
Yes, I think she would, returned Laurie gravely.
Don’t you like me so? asked Meg.
No, I don’t, was the blunt reply.
Why not? in an anxious tone.
I don’t like fuss and feathers.
They are making a fool of that little girl.
She’s nothing but a doll tonight.
Oh, dear! sighed Meg.
Please forgive my rudeness, and come and dance with me.
Not a bit of it, I’m dying to do it.
Come, I’ll be good.
Won’t I! said Laurie, with alacrity.
Please don’t tell them at home about my dress tonight.
They won’t understand the joke, and it will worry Mother.
But I’d rather do it myself.
No, not just now.
Don’t think I’m horrid.
Here comes Ned Moffat.
Marmee, I want to ‘fess’.
I thought so.
Of course not.
We are prepared, said Mrs.
March, smiling but looking a little anxious.
Laurie thought I wasn’t proper.
Is that all? asked Jo, as Mrs.
There is something more, I think.
Don’t be sorry, I won’t let it hurt me.
I’ll not be sentimental or dissatisfied, Mother.
Mother, do you have ‘plans’, as Mrs.
Moffat said? asked Meg bashfully.
Moffat’s, I suspect.
March said, in her serious yet cheery way...
I want my daughters to be beautiful, accomplished, and good.
To be admired, loved, and respected.
Then we’ll be old maids, said Jo stoutly.
Don’t be troubled, Meg, poverty seldom daunts a sincere lover.
Leave these things to time.
One thing remember, my girls.
CHAPTER TEN THE P.C.
On one occasion, Mr.
By my faith, I envy him.
Father, we wait your services.
Now, my children, let the play end.
Unmask and receive my blessing.
PICKWICK Why is the P.
A grocerman bought and put it in his shop.
Yours respectably, N.
Snowball Pat Paw.
Hannah Brown will preside, and all are invited to attend.
is requested not to whistle in the street.
please don’t forget Amy’s napkin.
must not fret because his dress has not nine tucks.
WEEKLY REPORT Meg—Good.
Snodgrass rose to make a proposition.
I propose Mr.
Theodore Laurence as an honorary member of the P.
Come now, do have him.
We’ll put it to a vote, said the President.
Contrary-minded say, ‘No’.
Meg and Amy were contrary-minded, and Mr.
Up rose Snodgrass, very much in earnest.
Now then, vote again.
Aye! Aye! Aye! replied three voices at once.
The coolness of you two rascals is amazing, began Mr.
Come now, don’t lay it all on yourself.
Never mind what she says.
Great applause as Mr.
She means vampire, not seaweed, but it doesn’t matter.
No, said Jo, that dozy way wouldn’t suit me.
I’ll say ‘nightingales’ then, with Laurie.
That’s proper and appropriate, since he’s a warbler.
Well, I will, if Mother doesn’t mind.
May we, Mother? asked Meg, turning to Mrs.
March, who sat sewing in what they called ‘Marmee’s corner’.
Next morning, Meg did not appear till ten o’clock.
Hoping to impress the lesson more deeply, Mrs.
We’ll have lettuce and make a salad.
I don’t know how, but the book tells.
Of course I shall.
I’m not a fool.
Get what you like, and don’t disturb me.
March, when Jo spoke to her.
If Amy is bothering, I’ll shake her.
Now, don’t cry, Bethy.
Oh, what is it? exclaimed Jo, trembling.
They did sober themselves for Beth’s sake.
Not a bit like home, added Amy.
As she spoke, Mrs.
I don’t! cried Jo decidedly.
Nor I, echoed the others.
Suppose you learn plain cooking.
Work is wholesome, and there is plenty for everyone.
We’ll remember, Mother! and they did.
I think Mr.
Brooke did it, for this isn’t Laurie’s writing.
March smiled and was satisfied.
In a big, dashing hand, Laurie wrote...
They are nice people, and like such things.
I hope the Vaughns are not fine grown-up people.
Do you know anything about them, Jo? asked Meg.
Only that there are four of them.
Laurie knew them abroad, and liked the boys.
Brooke, he is so kind.
That’s my good girl.
And I got a note from Mr.
There goes the man with the tent! I see Mrs.
Laurence is looking up at the sky and the weathercock.
I wish he would go too.
One is lame, poor thing, he’s got a crutch.
Laurie didn’t tell us that.
Be quick, girls! It’s getting late.
Why, there is Ned Moffat, I do declare.
How queer that he should come.
I thought he was at the mountains.
There is Sallie.
I’m glad she got back in time.
Am I all right, Jo? cried Meg in a flutter.
A regular daisy.
Ned’s assurances that he came especially to see her.
Laurence waving his hat on the shore.
Laurie and Jo rowed one boat, Mr.
Brooke chose Meg, Kate, and Fred.
Laurie took Sallie, Jo, and Ned.
You pushed it.
I saw you.
It’s my turn now, said Jo sharply.
Upon my word, I didn’t move it.
It rolled a bit, perhaps, but that is allowed.
Yankees are a deal the most tricky, everybody knows.
There you go! returned Fred, croqueting her ball far away.
By George, it’s all up with us! Goodbye, Kate.
Time for lunch, said Mr.
Brooke, looking at his watch.
Have games till it’s cooler.
Go and ask her.
She’s company, and you ought to stay with her more.
Please start it, Mr.
He went and knocked.
The great door flew open, and he beheld...
‘Oh, rise!’ she said, extending a hand of marble fairness.
They reached a curtained door, behind which sounded lovely music.
Of course the British beat—they always do.
No, they don’t! cried Jo, aside.
‘Cabbages!’ continued Laurie promptly.
‘Will you give me a rose?’ said he.
‘You must come and get it.
Whether he did or not, Frank will tell you.
Beth had disappeared behind Jo, and Grace was asleep.
Do you know Truth? I hope so, said Meg soberly.
The game, I mean? What is it? said Fred.
It’s great fun.
Let’s try it, said Jo, who liked new experiments.
Miss Kate and Mr.
Who are your heroes? asked Jo.
Grandfather and Napoleon.
Which lady here do you think prettiest? said Sallie.
Which do you like best? from Fred.
Jo, of course.
Truth isn’t a bad game, said Fred.
Her turn came next.
A quick temper.
What do you most wish for? said Laurie.
Not a true answer.
You must say what you really do want most.
Courage and honesty.
Now my turn, said Fred, as his hand came last.
Didn’t you cheat at croquet? Well, yes, a little bit.
I should be ashamed of myself if I didn’t.
He’s a true John Bull.
What do you hate most? asked Fred.
Spiders and rice pudding.
What do you like best? asked Jo.
Dancing and French gloves.
Well, I think Truth is a very silly play.
I haven’t time.
Your mamma prefers other accomplishments, I fancy.
Very fine schools they are, too, Papa says.
I am a governess myself.
Did the German song suit, Miss March? inquired Mr.
Brooke, breaking an awkward pause.
And Meg’s downcast face brightened as she spoke.
Not very well.
Try a little now.
I’ll read a bit to encourage you.
Some of it is.
Try this passage.
There was a queer smile about Mr.
Brooke’s mouth as he opened at poor Mary’s lament.
Very well indeed! said Mr.
I must look after Grace, she is romping.
What odd people these Yankees are.
I’m afraid Laurie will be quite spoiled among them.
There’s no place like America for us workers, Miss Margaret.
I’m glad I live in it then.
I only wished I liked teaching as you do.
Brooke, busily punching holes in the turf.
I am needed.
I am glad of that! exclaimed Meg.
Thank you, that sounds pleasant, began Mr.
I dote upon it.
Tell me about Ellen Tree.
Is it a donkey? asked Grace curiously.
How funny! laughed Grace.
Can I do anything for you? Talk to me, please.
Ned, getting sentimental, warbled a serenade with the pensive refrain...
Alone, alone, ah! Woe, alone, and at the lines...
I quite agree with you, said Mr.
Perhaps they forgot it.
I’ll take it to them, and see what’s going on.
I’ve no objection, if you do something.
He’ll laugh, said Amy warningly.
Who cares? said Jo.
I guess he’ll like it, added Beth.
Tell away, Jo, and don’t be afraid.
Yes, I know, said Laurie, nodding wisely.
Who told you? demanded Jo.
No, I did.
You can’t keep a secret.
Never mind, it saves trouble now.
It seems so long to wait, so hard to do.
You’ll have me for company, if that’s any comfort.
You’d have to take your favorite one.
What is it? asked Meg.
That’s my favorite castle.
Don’t you wish for anything else? asked Laurie.
Since I had my little piano, I am perfectly satisfied.
Hang college! muttered Laurie with an impatient sigh.
Here’s mine! and Amy waved her pencil.
I haven’t got any, said Meg forlornly.
Yes, you have, said Laurie at once.
Where? In your face.
Nonsense, that’s of no use.
What a venerable party! said Jo.
That’s not right, Jo.
Brooke has, by being respected and loved.
Please don’t be offended.
Forgive me, I meant it kindly.
I’m cross and have been out of sorts all day.
I thank you all the same.
May I come again? asked Laurie.
That night, when Beth played to Mr.
You got through quickly.
You’re the oddest fellow I ever saw.
So are you.
I’m glad of that.
I’ll teach you whether we play _Hamlet_ or not.
It’s grand fun and will straighten you up capitally.
Do you? Not often.
I wish you wouldn’t.
It’s no harm, Jo.
That depends upon how and where he takes it.
Won’t she? asked Laurie anxiously.
Well, she needn’t get out her bandboxes yet.
I’ll be a double distilled saint.
I can’t bear saints.
You think I’m likely to do the same? Much obliged.
I shouldn’t worry then.
Of course not.
Why? Because if you are, I’ll take a bus.
Very well, then, come on.
Come, you begin.
And you won’t tease me in private? I never tease.
Yes, you do.
You get everything you want out of people.
It won’t fail.
I know where Meg’s glove is.
All this time? Yes, isn’t that romantic? No, it’s horrid.
Don’t you like it? Of course I don’t.
It’s ridiculous, it won’t be allowed.
I didn’t promise.
That was understood, and I trusted you.
I thought you’d be pleased.
I’d like to see anyone try it, cried Jo fiercely.
So should I! and Laurie chuckled at the idea.
You have been running, Jo.
I’m afraid I do.
Why? asked Meg, looking surprised.
I hope she won’t.
Have you anything interesting there? asked Meg, with condescension.
You’d better read it aloud.
The Rival Painters.
That sounds well.
Read it, said Meg.
I prefer the lovering part.
You? cried Meg, dropping her work.
It’s very good, said Amy critically.
Miss Josephine March, actually printed in the paper.
How Beth got excited, and skipped and sang with joy.
How proud Mrs.
March was when she knew it.
Tell us about it.
We might as well be in a treadmill.
My patience, how blue we are! cried Jo.
It’s a dreadfully unjust world, said Meg bitterly.
Meg sighed, and turned to the frostbitten garden again.
In they both came, Mrs.
Much obliged, but I’m busy.
At the word ‘telegraph’, Mrs.
March: Your husband is very ill.
Come at once.
HALE Blank Hospital, Washington.
She’s right, there’s no time for tears now.
Be calm, girls, and let me think.
Send a telegram saying I will come at once.
The next train goes early in the morning.
I’ll take that.
What else? The horses are ready.
Leave a note at Aunt March’s.
Jo, give me that pen and paper.
There is no need of that.
Jo, run to the rooms, and tell Mrs.
King that I can’t come.
On the way get these things.
Hospital stores are not always good.
Beth, go and ask Mr.
Laurence for a couple of bottles of old wine.
I’m not too proud to beg for Father.
He shall have the best of everything.
But the last was impossible.
I came to offer myself as escort to your mother.
The short afternoon wore away.
I didn’t beg, borrow, or steal it.
My dear girl, there was no need of this.
Tell me all about it, Jo.
March with a look that warmed Jo’s heart.
Her son, she said, who was in the army.
I never snivel over trifles like that.
Good night, my darlings, said Mrs.
What then? My...
I’m not sorry, protested Jo, with a choke.
I’d do it again tomorrow, if I could.
Don’t tell anyone, it’s all over now.
Think about something pleasant, and you’ll soon drop off.
I tried it, but felt wider awake than ever.
What color do you like best? Brown, that is, sometimes.
Blue are lovely.
Children, I leave you to Hannah’s care and Mr.
Greatheart’ on the spot.
Laurence, faithful Hannah, and devoted Laurie.
I don’t see how they can help it, returned Mr.
Brooke, laughing so infectiously that Mrs.
March could not help smiling.
I shall go to Aunt March, as usual.
No need of that.
Goodbye, Meggy, I hope the Kings won’t strain today.
Don’t fret about Father, dear, she added, as they parted.
And I hope Aunt March won’t croak.
That’s my only comfort.
How very kind Mr.
Brooke is, and how fortunate that Mr.
The girls are all as good as gold.
Hannah is a perfect saint.
I declared I wouldn’t and got mad.
It lasted all day.
I felt bad and wanted you very much.
Kiss dear Father on the cheek he calls mine.
Oh, do come soon to your loving...
Adieu, I send heaps of love to Papa.
Your affectionate daughter...
The girls is clever and fly round right smart.
Miss Meg is going to make a proper good housekeeper.
We have got on very economical so fur.
My bread is riz, so no more at this time.
I send my duty to Mr.
March, and hope he’s seen the last of his Pewmonia.
Yours respectful, Hannah Mullet Head Nurse of Ward No.
COLONEL TEDDY Dear Madam: The little girls are all well.
Beth and my boy report daily.
Glad the fine weather holds.
Don’t let your husband want anything.
Thank God he is mending.
Meg, I wish you’d go and see the Hummels.
You know Mother told us not to forget them.
said Beth, ten days after Mrs.
Can’t you, Jo? asked Beth.
Too stormy for me with my cold.
I thought it was almost well.
Why don’t you go yourself? asked Meg.
Beth spoke earnestly, and Meg promised she would go tomorrow.
An hour passed.
Why? Then I’ll tell you.
Oh, Jo, the baby’s dead! What baby? Mrs.
Hummel came with the doctor.
‘Scarlet fever, ma’am.
Ought to have called me before,’ he said crossly.
I’ll call Hannah, she knows all about sickness.
Don’t let Amy come.
I guess not.
Don’t care if I do.
I shall, because it’s my fault she is sick.
Meg reasoned, pleaded, and commanded, all in vain.
Bless your heart, child, it’s to keep you well.
Well—I guess I will, said Amy slowly.
She is lying down on Mother’s bed, and feels better.
Well, don’t make a porcupine of yourself, it isn’t becoming.
That is what troubles me, said Meg.
Hum, well, I can’t say.
Suppose you ask Grandfather after the doctor has been.
Jo, go and get Dr.
Bangs at once, commanded Meg.
We can’t decide anything till he has been.
Stay where you are, Jo.
I’m afraid you are busy, began Meg.
No, I’ve done my lessons for the day.
Do you study in vacation time? asked Jo.
Aunt March received them with her usual hospitality.
No boys allowed here.
Laurie retired to the window, and Jo told her story.
Don’t cry, child, it worries me to hear people sniff.
Father is much better, replied Jo, trying to keep sober.
Oh, is he? Well, that won’t last long, I fancy.
March never had any stamina, was the cheerful reply.
The girls knew nothing about illness, and Mr.
A letter from Washington added to their trouble, for Mr.
Laurie haunted the house like a restless ghost, and Mr.
Everyone missed Beth.
March can leave her husband she’d better be sent for.
March was mending again.
The doctor told us to.
Yes, it is.
Thank you, Teddy, I’m better now.
Keep hoping for the best, that will help you, Jo.
I’m so glad Father is better.
Now she won’t feel so bad about leaving him.
Doesn’t Meg pull fair? asked Laurie, looking indignant.
Beth is my conscience, and I can’t give her up.
Poor girl, you’re worn out.
It isn’t like you to be forlorn.
Stop a bit.
I’ll hearten you up in a jiffy.
Laurie, though decidedly amazed, behaved with great presence of mind.
I don’t mind, laughed Laurie, as he settled his tie.
Why, you see I got fidgety, and so did Grandpa.
She’d never forgive us if Beth...
Well, if anything happened, you know.
No, thank you.
I’ll do it by proxy, when your grandpa comes.
Everything appeared to feel the hopeful change.
March’s countenance as she entered.
Hark! cried Jo, starting to her feet.
I, too, covet that, but not as a necklace.
Truly, yes, to pray with.
I wish I could.
To you and your sisters.
I know it, Madame confides in me.
I do like Aunt March after all.
I poked it out, and it ran under the bookcase.
Also my $100, to do what he likes with.
To our venerable benefactor Mr.
Anni Domino 1861.
Amy Curtis March Witnesses: Estelle Valnor, Theodore Laurence.
She never thought of a will.
Laurie added it, smiling at Amy’s last and greatest sacrifice.
What a strange yet pleasant day that was.
I think my little girl is learning this.
Aunt gave me the ring today.
I’ll try not to be vain, said Amy.
Do you mean Aunt March? asked her mother, laughing.
No, to remind me not to be selfish.
Wear your ring, dear, and do your best.
Now I must go back to Beth.
What is it, deary? asked Mrs.
I want to tell you something, Mother.
Beth is asleep.
Speak low, and tell me all about it.
That Moffat hasn’t been here, I hope? asked Mrs.
March rather sharply.
We forgot about it, till Teddy told me that Mr.
March, with an anxious look.
Now Meg does not do anything of the sort.
I call him ‘John’ now.
Oh, dear! I know you’ll take his part.
And Jo pulled her hair again with a wrathful tweak.
John went with me at Mr.
Of course not.
It would be idiotic! I knew there was mischief brewing.
I felt it, and now it’s worse than I imagined.
This odd arrangement made Mrs.
You don’t like it, Mother? I’m glad of it.
I did wrong to sigh, Jo.
He is younger than she, you know, began Mrs.
March, but Jo broke in...
Only one of my stupid speeches.
I’m going to bed.
Come, Peggy, said Jo, unfolding herself like an animated puzzle.
Quite right, and beautifully written.
March, returning the look with a keen one.
I’m glad of that, he is so lonely.
Good night, Mother, dear.
This left Jo to her own devices, for Mrs.
Nothing but wait.
Here’s a note to you, Meg, all sealed up.
It’s all a mistake, he didn’t send it.
Stop, Jo, you must clear yourself first.
I should think you’d have known Mr.
Oh, Meg, you didn’t answer it? cried Mrs.
I can’t rest till I get hold of him.
And Jo made for the door again.
Margaret, tell me the whole story, commanded Mrs.
Forgive me, Mother, I’m paid for my silliness now.
I never can look him in the face again.
What did you say to him? asked Mrs.
Don’t have any secrets, Jo.
Bless you, child! Mother told me.
That will do, Jo.
I’ll comfort Meg while you go and get Laurie.
Away ran Jo, and Mrs.
March gently told Meg Mr.
Brooke’s real feelings.
March received the culprit alone.
Meg pardoned him, and Mrs.
Yes, Miss, but I don’t believe he’s seeable just yet.
I’ll go and see what the matter is.
I’m not afraid of either of them.
Jo immediately knocked again.
It’s all right.
Thank you, I will.
Who did it? demanded Jo.
If it had been anyone else I’d have...
Then I bolted, for fear I should forget myself.
I’ll help you.
He didn’t know that.
What pepper pots you are! sighed Jo.
Bless you! He won’t do that.
I won’t go down till he does.
Now, Teddy, be sensible.
Let it pass, and I’ll explain what I can.
I’ll go to Washington and see Brooke.
It’s gay there, and I’ll enjoy myself after the troubles.
It would be a glorious joke.
Let’s do it, Jo.
I’ve got money enough.
Don’t tempt me, Teddy, it’s a crazy plan.
Hold your tongue! cried Jo, covering her ears.
Come in! and Mr.
That won’t do.
Out with it, Jo.
I won’t be kept in the dark.
Indeed, Sir, I cannot tell.
Mother forbade it.
Laurie has confessed, asked pardon, and been punished quite enough.
It was partly my fault, but it’s all right now.
He’s a stubborn fellow and hard to manage, said Mr.
Oh, dear no, Sir.
I’ll tell you, he’ll run away.
She laughed as she spoke, and Mr.
Laurence looked relieved, evidently taking the whole as a joke.
I won’t bear it.
He won’t come, Sir.
I think the shaking hurt his feelings very much.
If I were you, I’d write him an apology, Sir.
He likes fun, and this way is better than talking.
I’ll carry it up, and teach him his duty.
Jo dropped a kiss on the top of Mr.
No, he was pretty mild, on the whole.
Ah! I got it all round.
Go and eat your dinner, you’ll feel better after it.
The invalids improved rapidly, and Mr.
To begin with, Mr.
Laurence had insisted on giving it.
How can I be otherwise? said Mrs.
But it was too late.
As the laugh subsided, Mrs.
March began to thank Mr.
Brooke suddenly remembered that Mr.
March needed rest, and seizing Laurie, he precipitately retired.
Also why Mrs.
Laurence and his grandson dined with them, also Mr.
Brooke, at whom Jo glowered darkly, to Laurie’s infinite amusement.
Brooke with dignity.
How do you know? Did Mother tell you? asked Jo.
Here is one.
And, Lord! Contentment still I crave, Because Thou savest such.
Fulness to them a burden is, That go on pilgrimage.
Brooke’s umbrella, which had been left in the hall.
He’s showing you how your John will go on by-and-by.
Touching, isn’t it? answered Jo scornfully.
I see it, and so does Mother.
I’m not so silly and weak as you think.
Not at all.
Don’t mean to have any.
No, I won’t.
It’s very well, he’s in the rack.
I’ll get him, and tell it you are here.
Mother will like to see you.
Pray sit down, I’ll call her.
Are you afraid of me, Margaret? and Mr.
Shall I tell you how? asked Mr.
I won’t trouble you.
I love you so much, dear, added Mr.
Please choose to learn, Meg.
This nettled her.
Please go away and let me be! Poor Mr.
Yes, I do.
I don’t want to be worried about such things.
Don’t play with me, Meg.
I didn’t think that of you.
Don’t think of me at all.
March’s arrival, drove straight out to see him.
Brooke vanished into the study.
It’s Father’s friend.
That’s evident, returned Aunt March, sitting down.
We were only talking.
Brooke came for his umbrella, began Meg, wishing that Mr.
Brooke and the umbrella were safely out of the house.
Brooke? That boy’s tutor? Ah! I understand now.
I know all about it.
Hush! He’ll hear.
Shan’t I call Mother? said Meg, much troubled.
You ought to marry well and help your family.
Father and Mother don’t think so.
They like John though he is poor.
I’m glad of it, cried Meg stoutly.
He hasn’t any business, has he? Not yet.
Laurence is going to help him.
That won’t last long.
He knows you have got rich relations, child.
That’s the secret of his liking, I suspect.
We are willing to work and we mean to wait.
No, I won’t stop.
Don’t expect anything from me when you are married.
Brooke’s friends must take care of you.
I’m done with you forever.
At the odd sound the lovers turned and saw her.
No, I’m sure I can’t.
I hope the third year from this will end better.
Now we shall have some sensible conversation.
Much obliged for that recommendation.
You don’t give her up.
You only go halves, said Laurie consolingly.
It can never be the same again.
I’ve lost my dearest friend, sighed Jo.
You’ve got me, anyhow.
I know you will, and I’m ever so much obliged.
Well, now, don’t be dismal, there’s a good fellow.
It’s all right you see.
So the curtain falls upon Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy.
The war is over, and Mr.
Gifted men found a companion in him.
That was the name of the little brown house Mr.
Brooke had prepared for Meg’s first home.
Brooke came home’.
In vain Meg begged him to stop.
John laughed at him, and Jo called him ‘Mr.
So each week beheld some fresh absurdity.
Sallie Moffat has four, began Amy.
That’s a housewifely taste which I am glad to see.
And Meg looked quite contented, as well she might.
March, with both hands out and a hearty...
Here I am, Mother! Yes, it’s all right.
John Brooke, with the maker’s congratulations and compliments.
Bless you, Beth! What a refreshing spectacle you are, Jo.
Where is John? asked Meg anxiously.
Stopped to get the license for tomorrow, ma’am.
Ours, of course.
Wish you’d been there to see.
More cruel than ever.
Mother and I are going to wait for John.
Come, Jo, don’t desert a fellow.
Not a prank.
I never do.
You are the one for that.
I shall certainly laugh if you do.
I never cry unless for some great affliction.
Don’t be a peacock.
I only moaned a trifle to keep the girls company.
No, I don’t.
Then don’t go and be suspicious.
You spend a great deal, Teddy.
We heard about Henshaw and all you did for him.
Oh, he made a mountain out of a molehill.
Of course he had.
Don’t be alarmed.
I’m not one of the agreeable sort.
I don’t like that sort of thing.
Now don’t say any more about it.
Neither silk, lace, nor orange flowers would she have.
Then I am satisfied.
Beth has grown slender, pale, and more quiet than ever.
You oughtn’t to be seen till the last minute, child.
John, dear, here’s your hammer.
I give you my word for it.
Brooke! I thank you, very, very much.
But the crowning joke was Mr.
Moffat to her husband, as they drove away.
Thank you all for my happy wedding day.
Everybody liked her, for among her good gifts was tact.
Why should they? and Mrs.
The ugly duckling turned out a swan, you know.
That looks feasible.
I’ve calculated the cost, and I’ll pay for it myself.
Thanks, Mother, you are always so kind.
That’s not my way.
To begin with, Hannah’s cooking didn’t turn out well.
Beth got a cold and took to her bed.
Oh, really, I beg pardon.
March, suiting the action to the word.
Take it all.
Germans like messes.
March, in a tone full of motherly regret.
I am satisfied.
and he pointed to the name of Mrs.
Northbury, under the title of the tale.
Do you know her? asked Jo, with sudden interest.
You can do better than this, Jo.
Aim at the highest, and never mind the money.
I think the money is the best part of it.
March declared she felt ten years younger.
Yes, said Jo, knitting her brows, that’s just it.
I wouldn’t leave a word out of it.
Do as he tells you.
He knows what will sell, and we don’t.
You said, Mother, that criticism would help me.
Her family and friends administered comfort and commendation liberally.
While the cooking mania lasted she went through Mrs.
She did her best, she asked advice of Mrs.
March had advised the plan.
I shall always be prepared.
The front door usually stood hospitably open.
I’m afraid something has happened.
Step into the garden, Scott, while I look up Mrs.
Brooke, said John, alarmed at the silence and solitude.
In the kitchen reigned confusion and despair.
Brooke, with her apron over her head, sat sobbing dismally.
Yes, sobbed Meg despairingly.
Tell me quick, then.
I can bear anything better than that.
Out with it, love.
I should hope not! Take him away at once.
I can’t see him, and there isn’t any dinner.
I hadn’t time to cook anything.
I meant to dine at Mother’s.
Give us the cold meat, and bread and cheese.
We won’t ask for jelly.
I’m too used up to ‘exert’ myself for anyone.
I won’t have anything of the sort in my house.
You won’t have anything else here.
No, by George, it wasn’t! And Meg must know it.
She was wrong, of course, but then she was young.
I must be patient and teach her.
I’ve no objection, was Meg’s equally soothing remark.
Brooke and wet-blanketed by Mrs.
Brooke, and conversation languished.
Of course that settled it.
Forgive me, dear.
After this, Meg had Mr.
In the autumn, new trials and experiences came to Meg.
You haven’t seen my private expense book yet.
Well, dear, what is the ‘dem’d total’, as Mr.
I do my best, Meg.
The good-natured Mrs.
We didn’t want no hurrycanes round.
No, thank you.
I’d rather not.
A peal of laughter from Jo, Amy, Mrs.
I never was more staggered in my life.
Boy and girl.
Most remarkable children I ever saw.
Besides, one has blue eyes and one brown.
Kiss them, Uncle Teddy, said wicked Jo.
Of course they will, they are used to it now.
CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE CALLS Come, Jo, it’s time.
Yes, you did, it was a bargain between us.
Now, that’s shirking.
It pays for you to be fine.
It doesn’t for me, and furbelows only worry me.
Well, I’ll go if I must, and do my best.
Take your light gloves and the embroidered handkerchief.
You’re highly satisfactory.
Turn slowly round, and let me get a careful view.
You haven’t half buttoned one cuff, do it at once.
Let me see.
In vain Mrs.
Try to be sociable at the Lambs’.
I’ll be agreeable.
Amy was taken possession of by Mrs.
She rides splendidly.
Who taught her? No one.
None of them.
Her struggles were really pathetic.
Well, I call that plucky! and young Mr.
It’s a great comfort to have an artistic sister.
That’s nothing compared to some of her brilliant performances.
There’s nothing the child can’t do.
Sorry you could find nothing better to read.
Amy, we must go.
Good-by, dear, do come and see us.
We are pining for a visit.
I don’t dare to ask you, Mr.
Nothing could have been worse, was Amy’s crushing reply.
Just as you please.
I wash my hands of you, was Amy’s short answer.
Then I’ll enjoy myself.
It might have been worse, but Amy considered it bad.
Why do you always avoid Mr.
You might treat him civilly, at least.
Tommy is poor and bashful and good and very clever.
It’s no use trying to argue with you, began Amy.
Speak for yourself, if you please.
I should rather enjoy the brickbats and hooting, I think.
It’s my doom, and I can’t help it.
I’m not, put in Jo decidedly.
I am willing to work.
Patronage does not trouble me when it is well meant.
Quite right and proper.
I like your grateful spirit, my dear.
It’s a pleasure to help people who appreciate our efforts.
I’d rather do everything for myself, and be perfectly independent.
Do you speak French, dear? asked Mrs.
Carrol, laying a hand on Amy’s.
How are you about languages? asked Mrs.
Carrol of Jo.
Don’t know a word.
Most observing bird, said the old lady.
Thank you, I will.
You’d better do it, Mary.
I’ll supply the money.
CHAPTER THIRTY CONSEQUENCES Mrs.
It shall be as you please, Mrs.
Now she’s mad.
But everything seemed against her.
It was late, and she was tired.
She heard May say sorrowfully...
The table was just complete then.
Now it’s spoiled.
Now, that was hard.
The art table was the most attractive in the room.
Her mother gave her an extra cordial cup of tea.
returned Jo, leaning over the gate to watch for Laurie.
But we mustn’t stand philandering here.
Good evening, Miss Jo.
Everything of Amy’s sold long ago.
To May’s great delight, Mr.
Why, girls, you needn’t praise me so.
I only did as I’d be done by.
A letter came from Aunt Carrol, and Mrs.
Aunt Carrol is going abroad next month, and wants...
No, dear, not you.
Oh, Mother! She’s too young, it’s my turn first.
I’ve wanted it so long.
I must go! I’m afraid it’s impossible, Jo.
It’s always so.
It isn’t fair, oh, it isn’t fair! cried Jo passionately.
I’m afraid it’s partly your own fault, dear.
March said sorrowfully...
No, you won’t.
Hum! said Jo, with a sigh.
Amy likewise bore up stoutly till the steamer sailed.
Everyone was very kind to me, especially the officers.
I never shall forget it.
At Queenstown one of my new acquaintances left us, Mr.
I’ve given ’em the latest Yankee shine.
It amused Uncle immensely.
Wasn’t that fun, girls? I like traveling.
I never shall get to London if I don’t hurry.
This is the way we went on.
A colliery, remarks Uncle, with a twinkle of the eye.
See, Papa, aren’t they pretty? added Flo sentimentally.
We rested, unpacked, and shopped a little between the showers.
Shopping in Regent Street is perfectly splendid.
Things seem so cheap, nice ribbons only sixpence a yard.
The Duke of Devonshire lives near.
In the P.M.
Rainy days I spend in the Louvre, revelling in pictures.
Then the Bois and Champs Elysees are _tres magnifique_.
That is so Frenchy.
Adieu, I embrace you tenderly.
Get Father’s old guidebooks and read about it.
I haven’t words beautiful enough to describe it.
Frankfurt was delightful.
I wish Jo would tell me all about it.
I can’t help it if people like me.
I like him, and we get on comfortably together.
I like it, for it’s genuine.
One of us _must_ marry well.
I wouldn’t marry a man I hated or despised.
He said nothing, but little things showed it.
Send me as much advice as you like.
I’ll use it if I can.
Love and trust me.
I found her crying over the babies the other day.
This isn’t like Beth, and it worries me.
So she is.
It’s a great comfort, Jo.
Happy woman! I’ve got heaps.
They are not very wearing, so they’ll keep.
I never dreamed of such a thing.
What will Mother say? I wonder if her...
there Jo stopped and turned scarlet with a sudden thought.
Oh dear, we are growing up with a vengeance.
Now, this is filling at the price.
No slang, snapped Jo, slamming down the pillow.
Come, Jo, don’t be thorny.
Beth will pet you.
I’d give anything if I could answer, ‘So do you’.
I’m glad you can’t flirt.
I’m dying for some music, and always like yours.
I’d rather stay here, thank you.
Well, you can’t, there isn’t room.
Are you going? demanded Jo, diving for the pillow.
You can’t, there is no cure.
I shall be better soon.
Lie down here and ‘poor’ my head.
I’ll be quiet and go to sleep, indeed I will.
I know it.
I’ll tell you by-and-by.
Go to sleep, dear.
I’ll stay with you.
You asked me the other day what my wishes were.
Where will you hop? To New York.
I had a bright idea yesterday, and this is it.
You know Mrs.
March looked surprised, but not displeased.
It’s not exactly going out to service, for Mrs.
Don’t care if they do.
It’s honest work, and I’m not ashamed of it.
But your writing? All the better for the change.
March looked anxious as she put the question.
I’m glad of that, Jo.
He hasn’t said anything, but he looks a great deal.
Meg is so, and I am content with her success.
You mean your papers? asked Beth.
No, my boy.
Now, my dear, make yourself at home, said Mrs.
The little back is too young to haf such heaviness.
When I mentioned it to Mrs.
lends him her parlor for some of his scholars.
He’s almost forty, so it’s no harm, Marmee.
Thou shalt haf thy Bhaer.
I fancy he has a hard life of it.
Handsome head, but no style.
Not a bit of it.
Give us a light and come on.
The little thing has lost her heart to Mr.
But he enjoys it like a boy, Mrs.
I was in our parlor last evening when Mr.
Bhaer came in with some newspapers for Mrs.
This is Mamma’s friend, Miss March.
You haf a fine day to make your walk.
Bon voyage, Mademoiselle.
She put it as a favor, but I’m sure Mrs.
We are playing nargerie, explained Kitty.
Bhaer? said Minnie.
Pray forward Amy’s as soon as you can spare them.
From your faithful Jo.
To begin at the beginning, Mrs.
Kirke called to me one day as I passed Mr.
Bhaer’s room where she was rummaging.
Half-finished boats and bits of string lay among the manuscripts.
Such a man! laughed good-natured Mrs.
K., as she put the relics in the rag bag.
It’s dreadful, but I can’t scold him.
Let me mend them, said I.
I don’t mind it, and he needn’t know.
I haf a heart, and I feel thanks for this.
Now we shall try a new way.
I do him in German, gif me your ear.
Tell me something nice, Marmee.
You see Beth manages him better than I did.
Read him bits of my letters.
Thank Heaven Beth continues so comfortable.
and a young man by the name of Teddy.
Bhaer gave me a fine Shakespeare.
You say often you wish a library.
Now don’t laugh at his horrid name.
Mother would admire his warm heart, Father his wise head.
I was so glad of that.
I didn’t mean to go down, having no dress.
But at the last minute, Mrs.
So I dressed up as Mrs.
Malaprop, and sailed in with a mask on.
Meg will relish that joke.
Bless you all! Ever your loving...
Dashwood, editor of the Weekly Volcano.
Excuse me, I was looking for the Weekly Volcano office.
I wished to see Mr.
While she blushed and blundered, Mr.
Oh, did she? and Mr.
Well, you can leave it, if you like.
Now, Jo did _not_ like to leave it, for Mr.
When she went again, Mr.
Dashwood was alone, whereat she rejoiced.
Jo hardly knew her own MS.
People want to be amused, not preached at, you know.
Morals don’t sell nowadays.
Which was not quite a correct statement, by the way.
Dashwood’s affable reply.
Pay when it comes out, returned Mr.
Dashwood, as if that point had escaped him.
Such trifles do escape the editorial mind, it is said.
Well, we’ll look at it.
Can’t promise to take it.
Just as she likes, of course.
The tale will be out next week.
Good morning, Sir.
As she departed, Mr.
Dashwood’s directions, and making Mrs.
Why everybody liked him was what puzzled Jo, at first.
His capacious waistcoat was suggestive of a large heart underneath.
Bhaer had never told it.
This belief strengthened daily.
Yes, you are right to put it from you.
Being a little shortsighted, Mr.
Yes, that’s the best place for such inflammable nonsense.
Dashwood that morals didn’t sell.
I don’t know anything.
Kirke till June.
Everyone seemed sorry when the time came.
The children were inconsolable, and Mr.
Yes, come next month.
Laurie graduates then, and you’d enjoy commencement as something new.
Yes, my boy Teddy.
Something in Mr.
If it had not been for Tina on her knee.
She didn’t know what would have become of her.
They were all there, his grandfather—oh, so proud—Mr.
I forgot it.
Please don’t! I will, and you must hear me.
Say what you like then.
I’ll listen, said Jo, with a desperate sort of patience.
I’ve tried to show it, but you wouldn’t let me.
I wanted to save you this.
I thought you’d understand...
I thought so.
It was like you, but it was no use.
Really, truly, dear.
They do sometimes, said a muffled voice from the post.
That you love that old man.
That devilish Professor you were always writing about.
Pray, don’t fly into a passion.
You haven’t heard what I wanted to tell you.
No, I can’t.
I won’t be reasonable.
It won’t help me, and it only makes it harder.
I don’t believe you’ve got any heart.
I wish I hadn’t.
Say you will, and let’s be happy.
she began solemnly.
Yes, you will! persisted Jo.
I know better! broke in Laurie.
To the devil! was the consoling answer.
Now I must go and prepare Mr.
Laurence to be very kind to my poor boy.
Give us something gayer, lad, said Mr.
I want you.
I can’t stand this, muttered the old gentleman.
Laurence with unusual mildness.
Not if you are the gentleman I think you.
Where will you go? Anywhere.
I don’t ask you to go alone.
Who, Sir? stopping to listen.
There is business in London that needs looking after.
But you hate traveling, Sir.
I quite enjoy the idea.
It doesn’t matter where I go or what I do.
It does to me, remember that, my lad.
Promise me that, Laurie.
Anything you like, Sir.
Good, thought the old gentleman.
Being an energetic individual, Mr.
March, to attempt consolation or offer sympathy.
March kissed him, with a whisper full of motherly solicitude.
One day Beth told her.
I’ve tried to tell you, but I couldn’t.
Perhaps it was wrong, but I tried to do right.
I do love him dearly.
I hope he truly will be, sometime.
Not through me, said Jo decidedly.
I don’t care what becomes of anybody but you, Beth.
You must get well.
I can’t let you go.
I’ll work and pray and fight against it.
I’ll keep you in spite of everything.
There must be ways, it can’t be too late.
Simple, sincere people seldom speak much of their piety.
But, Beth, I don’t give up yet.
said Jo, trying to speak cheerfully.
I’m not like the rest of you.
I never thought of being married, as you all did.
Dear little bird! See, Jo, how tame it is.
I like peeps better than the gulls.
Jo, dear, don’t hope any more.
It won’t do any good.
I’m sure of that.
She was right.
The lady was young, blonde, and dressed in blue.
I called at your hotel, but you were out.
I was going for a drive and longing for company.
Flo’s saving up for tonight.
You’ll go with us, of course? Aunt will be charmed.
Now tell me all about yourself.
The dirt is picturesque, so I don’t mind.
It’s going to the Church of St.
Beth is very poorly, Mother says.
I think you are right, there.
It’s not much changed, he answered without enthusiasm.
Carrol, Laurie left them, promising to return in the evening.
Here are your flowers.
How kind you are! she exclaimed gratefully.
I thought you liked that sort of thing.
I meant the first dance.
Nice little boy, but rather a short Pole to support...
My rouge won’t come off.
Good name for it.
None of that, it is forbidden.
I’d rather take coffee than compliments just now.
No, don’t lounge, it makes me nervous.
Brooke was only interested in domestic news.
Goes on how, my dear? asked her mother anxiously.
Men are very selfish, even the best of them.
So are women.
But it can’t be right for him to neglect me.
I don’t see how.
Let me show you.
I think you could, dear, and I think you ought.
I’m afraid it won’t.
Make it so pleasant he won’t want to go away.
I nearly spoiled her by indulgence.
That is the secret of our home happiness.
Show me how, I’ll do anything you say.
You always were my docile daughter.
I don’t believe he would.
Now, dear, good-by.
Do you expect company? Only you, dear.
Ditto, ditto, Mr.
Well, it’s altogether delightful, and like old times.
This tastes right.
I drink your health, dear.
Me’s tummin! It’s that naughty boy.
No, it isn’t morning yet.
You must go to bed, and not trouble poor Mamma.
But John shook his head, and said to Meg...
Yes, of course.
You have made a slave of yourself long enough.
Put him in his bed and leave him, Meg.
I’ll manage him.
You must never say that to Papa.
I shall carry you if you don’t go yourself.
Go ’way, me don’t love Parpar.
and Demi retired to his mother’s skirts for protection.
Let me stay with him, he’ll be good now, John.
No, my dear.
Don’t interfere, I’ll manage him.
Go down, my dear, and leave the boy to me.
Please let me kiss him once, John? Certainly.
Poor little man, he’s worn out with sleep and crying.
I really need some music to put me in tune.
Even Sallie Moffatt liked to go there.
All the rest have gone to Monaco for the day.
I preferred to stay at home and write letters.
Then I’ll go with pleasure.
and he put out his hand for her sketchbook.
But she tucked it under her arm with a sharp...
Don’t trouble yourself.
The two never quarreled.
I dare say, short answers save trouble.
He expects you, and you really ought to go.
Hospitable creature! I know it.
Then why don’t you do it? Natural depravity, I suppose.
Natural indolence, you mean.
It’s really dreadful! and Amy looked severe.
What are you doing just now? Watching lizards.
I need a figure.
With all the pleasure in life.
As usual, ‘Go away, Teddy.
I’m all ready for the secrets.
I’ve none to tell.
You may begin.
Haven’t one to bless myself with.
I thought perhaps you’d had some news from home..
You have heard all that has come lately.
She’s very busy.
Never, she answered, with a despondent but decided air.
I want to be great, or nothing.
May I? I don’t promise to answer.
Your face will, if your tongue won’t.
Do it for me, there’s a dear girl.
I could, if I tried.
You’d be angry in five minutes.
I’m never angry with you.
It takes two flints to make a fire.
You are as cool and soft as snow.
You don’t know what I can do.
Snow produces a glow and a tingle, if applied rightly.
Flo and I have got a new name for you.
It’s Lazy Laurence.
Thank you, ladies.
Well, I despise you.
Strong language, mademoiselle.
If you like it, I’ll go on.
Pray do, it’s quite interesting.
I thought you’d find it so.
Selfish people always like to talk about themselves.
I said when we first met that you had improved.
I supposed you’d take it so.
I beg pardon, I thought...
and there she paused diplomatically.
It’s her fault though, and you may tell her so.
I was wrong, I didn’t know.
She hates lazy people.
Try it and see.
Neither spoke for several minutes.
As you are.
This is as you were.
and Amy laid another sketch beside the one he held.
Only a rough sketch of Laurie taming a horse.
You’ve improved immensely since then, and I congratulate you.
Now, I’ve offended him.
But both felt ill at ease.
Unfortunately I have an engagement.
Something in his face made Amy say quickly and warmly...
Tell him so, with my congratulations.
Not asleep, but so happy, dear.
See, I found this and read it.
I knew you wouldn’t care.
Then I don’t feel as if I’d wasted my life.
More than any one in the world, Beth.
I’ll try, Beth.
If it fails, they generously give her the whole.
It’s genius simmering, perhaps.
Very likely some Mrs.
I dare say you don’t, Mrs.
Grundy, but it’s true nevertheless.
Laurie’s heart wouldn’t ache.
I’ll try again, and if that fails, why then...
So I will, at once.
Amy never lectured now.
I was sure she would think better of it.
I came the minute I heard.
You needn’t say anything, this comforts me, she said softly.
I do, so much.
The moment Mrs.
At Nice, Laurie had lounged and Amy had scolded.
You must be tired.
Rest a little, and let me row.
Will you, Amy? very tenderly.
Yes, Laurie, very low.
I can’t do it.
Marriage is an excellent thing, after all.
Try it, dear.
Don’t believe I can.
I don’t understand it.
There is truth in it, Jo, that’s the secret.
You have had the bitter, now comes the sweet.
When Amy and Laurie wrote of their engagement, Mrs.
I’m not the scatterbrain I was.
You may trust me.
I’m sober and sensible enough for anyone’s confidante now.
But you are right in one thing.
I’d no idea hearts could take in so many.
I don’t understand it.
I do, and Mrs.
Wait for me, my friend.
Almost twenty-five, and nothing to show for it.
Jo was mistaken in that.
An old maid, that’s what I’m to be.
But, like Jenny in the ballad...
Then she knew him, and flew up, crying joyfully...
Where’s Amy? Your mother has got her down at Meg’s.
Actually married? Very much so, thank you.
Mercy on us.
So, come and ’fess, Teddy.
What does Amy call you? My lord.
That’s like her.
I couldn’t wait.
Now, start right, and tell me how it all happened.
I’m pining to know.
Fib number one.
Amy did it to please you.
Go on, and tell the truth, if you can, sir.
Now she’s beginning to marm it.
But Grandpa wanted to come home.
Of course you did.
You always have things to suit you.
Well, then Uncle and Aunt were there to play propriety.
We wanted to surprise you.
Amy and you changed places in my heart, that’s all.
I’m sure you feel this.
You are older.
Here’s a line, and there’s another.
You look a little wicked now.
I am sure of that.
Amy and you never did quarrel as we used to.
Moffat would be entirely eclipsed by young Mrs.
March proudly escorted Mrs.
March as proudly leaned on the arm of ‘my son’.
It won’t do to be dismal now.
No, we haven’t, only the family.
Come in, and make one of us.
Though a very social man, I think Mr.
Not ill, but tired and sorrowful.
We have had trouble since I saw you last.
Ah, yes, I know.
The women telegraphed their approval to one another, and Mr.
Laurence found it impossible to go to sleep.
But it did not last long.
Bhaer actually had gold sleeve-buttons in his immaculate wristbands.
Laurence went home to rest.
They were not all there.
The little chair stood in its old place.
I am here.
Play something, Amy.
I can’t show off tonight.
It was hard to say...
Now, we must finish with Mignon’s song, for Mr.
Bhaer sings that, said Jo, before the pause grew painful.
You will sing with me? We go excellently well together.
It didn’t much matter, for Mr.
He spoke to Mrs.
I suspect that is a wise man, remarked Mr.
I know he is a good one, added Mrs.
March, with decided approval, as she wound up the clock.
She wondered what the business was that brought Mr.
Come home, dear, and I’ll find your bootjack.
We have our plans.
I need something of the sort to keep me steady.
And Amy, what is she going to do? asked Mrs.
Time will show.
How happy those children seem together! observed Mr.
Yes, and I think it will last, added Mrs.
I know it will.
Now, Laurie, don’t be too fastidious and worldly-minded.
Women never should marry for money...
That accounts, perhaps, for your marrying a good-for-nothing like me.
You are not listening to my moral remarks, Mrs.
Shall you care if Jo does marry Mr.
Jo would find us out, and spoil it all.
Thank you, I’m afraid I don’t deserve that pretty compliment.
I want to see it go wound.
Now, Demi, tell me where you keep your mind.
Me likes to be sick.
But Demi corners her by the cool reply...
Then we’ll go and eat up all the raisins.
But when Mr.
March, so I suppose he was the attraction.
Prone upon the floor lay Mr.
Excuse me for a moment.
We are just finishing our lesson.
Now, Demi, make the letter and tell its name.
What have you been at today, bubchen? asked Mr.
Bhaer, picking up the gymnast.
Me went to see little Mary.
Prut! Thou beginnest early.
What did the little Mary say to that? asked Mr.
Thou shouldst save some for the little friend.
Sweets to the sweet, mannling, and Mr.
Bhaer—doesn’t like tea.
You’d better take the little umbrella, dear.
If you happen to meet Mr.
Bhaer, bring him home to tea.
I quite long to see the dear man, added Mrs.
Bhaer looking down.
What do you down here, my friend? I’m shopping.
No, I didn’t.
And you? I’m always glad to see you, sir.
That is so kind, I gladly tell you.
On learning his good fortune she almost clapped her hands.
Here’s the place for my errands.
Will you come in? It won’t take long.
May they haf oranges and figs? asked Mr.
Bhaer, with a paternal air.
They eat them when they can get them.
Do you care for nuts? Like a squirrel.
I’ll do it with pleasure, Mr.
Your lady may prefer this.
Does this suit you, Mr.
Yes, it’s late, and I’m _so_ tired.
Jo’s voice was more pathetic than she knew.
I beg your pardon.
I didn’t see the name distinctly.
Never mind, I can walk.
Ach, mein Gott, that is so good! cried Mr.
Friedrich, why didn’t you...
Bhaer, more like a romantic student than a grave professor.
Prut! That I do not believe.
I like that, cried Jo, delighted with her new name.
I found it by chance.
Read and find him.
I will see that you go not in the wet.
Meg on the first lid, smooth and fair.
I haf a heart full, full for her.
We shall see.
I have my duty, also, and my work.
You don’t mean to live there? Yes, I do.
Of what is this fine crop to consist, ma’am? Boys.
I like it, said Mrs.
Jo can do it, and be happy in it.
It’s a splendid idea.
Tell us all about it, cried Mr.
I knew you’d stand by me, sir.
They could help in the garden and orchard.
Laurence laughed till they thought he’d have an apoplectic fit.
Now don’t be a wet-blanket, Teddy.
They don’t complain much—plucky little souls—but they feel it.
Every room in the big house was soon full.
Every little plot in the garden soon had its owner.
The old orchard wore its holiday attire.
Goldenrod and asters fringed the mossy walls.
Squirrels were busy with their small harvesting.
Everybody was there.
Everybody laughed and sang, climbed up and tumbled down.
Laurence, while enjoying...
The gentle apple’s winey juice.
Everybody’s health was proposed, from Mr.
March and her daughters under the festival tree.
My castle was the most nearly realized of all.
Amy’s nature was growing sweeter, deeper, and more tender.
Don’t despond, but hope and keep happy, said Mrs.
Fritz is getting gray and stout.
I’m growing as thin as a shadow, and am thirty.
Not half so good as yours, Mother.
Touched to the heart, Mrs.
Anna Pávlovna had had a cough for some days.
Petersburg, used only by the elite.
First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are.
I must put in an appearance there, said the prince.
My daughter is coming for me to take me there.
I thought today’s fete had been canceled.
I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.
She is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe.
Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?...
She has refused to evacuate Malta.
What answer did Novosíltsev get? None.
This famous Prussian neutrality is just a trap.
You are so eloquent.
He is one of the genuine émigrés, the good ones.
And also the Abbé Morio.
The prince was silent and looked indifferent.
The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.
Two such charming children.
And she smiled her ecstatic smile.
I can’t help it, said the prince.
Lavater would have said I lack the bump of paternity.
What would you have me do? he said at last.
That is the only difference between them.
It is the cross I have to bear.
That is how I explain it to myself.
Anna Pávlovna meditated.
She is a relation of yours, Princess Mary Bolkónskaya.
He lives in the country.
The poor girl is very unhappy.
CHAPTER II Anna Pávlovna’s drawing room was gradually filling.
The Abbé Morio and many others had also come.
* The most fascinating woman in Petersburg.
But Pierre now committed a reverse act of impoliteness.
But amid these cares her anxiety about Pierre was evident.
At last he came up to Morio.
CHAPTER III Anna Pávlovna’s reception was in full swing.
The spindles hummed steadily and ceaselessly on all sides.
One, chiefly masculine, had formed round the abbé.
The third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna Pávlovna.
The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur, said she to another.
The princess smiled.
She smilingly waited.
Wait a moment, I’ll get my work....
Fetch me my workbag.
The vicomte told his tale very neatly.
The means are ...
You are off to the war, Prince? said Anna Pávlovna.
And Lise, your wife? She will go to the country.
I knew you would be here, replied Pierre.
I will come to supper with you.
Very lovely, said Prince Andrew.
Very, said Pierre.
Anna Pávlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand.
I can’t remain any longer in Petersburg.
That would be the best way.
Listen to me, Prince, said she.
This last consideration moved him.
Here is my hand on it.
You are on good terms with Michael Ilariónovich Kutúzov ...
Prince Vasíli smiled.
No, I won’t promise that.
Her task was accomplished.
And sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position.
Bâton de gueules, engrêlé de gueules d’azur—maison Condé, said he.
The princess listened, smiling.
He shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands.
That is doubtful, said Prince Andrew.
Not in the least, replied the vicomte.
Dieu! Mon Dieu! muttered Anna Pávlovna in a terrified whisper.
What, Monsieur Pierre...
Oh! Oh! exclaimed several voices.
The vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders.
But Pierre continued his speech without heeding her.
He could not do that.
What? Revolution and regicide a grand thing?...
Well, after that...
Rousseau’s Contrat Social, said the vicomte with a tolerant smile.
Have people since the Revolution become happier? On the contrary.
We wanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it.
His smile was unlike the half-smile of other people.
All were silent.
So it seems to me.
That was her taste.
And she had a lady’s maid, also big.
Here Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas with difficulty.
Suddenly there was a great wind.
And so the anecdote ended.
Pierre was ungainly.
Besides this he was absent-minded.
And everyone, including Anna Pávlovna, felt this.
It is settled, she added in a low voice.
Au revoir! —and she left the hall.
All the pretty women in society will be there.
Are you ready? he asked his wife, looking past her.
The postilion started, the carriage wheels rattled.
Hippolyte burst out laughing.
Pierre turned his whole body, making the sofa creak.
not by a balance of political power....
One can’t everywhere say all one thinks, mon cher.
Really, I don’t yet know.
I don’t like either the one or the other.
But you must decide on something! Your father expects it.
I will agree to anything.
It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was speaking.
Pierre rubbed his forehead.
That is all nonsense.
Prince Andrew again interrupted him, let us talk business.
There is a war now against Napoleon.
Prince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierre’s childish words.
And that would be splendid, said Pierre.
Prince Andrew smiled ironically.
Well, why are you going to the war? asked Pierre.
What for? I don’t know.
Besides that I am going....
Pierre removed his feet from the sofa.
The princess came in.
Prince Andrew rose and politely placed a chair for her.
The princess started.
Evidently Pierre’s words touched her to the quick.
Ah, that is just what I tell him! said she.
He is so well known, so much appreciated by everyone.
He is so well received everywhere.
He might easily become aide-de-camp to the Emperor.
You know the Emperor spoke to him most graciously.
Annette and I were speaking of how to arrange it.
When are you starting? he asked.
and then you know, André...
With my father and sister, remember, said Prince Andrew gently.
Alone all the same, without my friends....
And he expects me not to be afraid.
No, Andrew, I must say you have changed.
Oh, how you have....
You had better go.
Why is it? Lise! was all Prince Andrew said.
Calm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you because....
I assure you I myself have experienced ...
and so ...
No, excuse me! An outsider is out of place here....
No, don’t distress yourself....
Good-by! Prince Andrew caught him by the hand.
CHAPTER VIII The friends were silent.
Neither cared to begin talking.
They entered the elegant, newly decorated, and luxurious dining room.
It will all be wasted on trifles.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Don’t look at me with such surprise.
But what’s the good?...
and he waved his arm.
You have everything before you, everything.
How can he talk like that? thought Pierre.
My part is played out, said Prince Andrew.
That smile was immediately reflected on Pierre’s face.
Without a name and without means...
And it really...
But he did not say what it really was.
For the present I am free and am all right.
You’ll be all right anywhere.
One’s head aches, and one spends all one’s money.
He asked me for tonight, but I won’t go.
It was a cloudless, northern, summer night.
Pierre took an open cab intending to drive straight home.
I should like to go to Kurágin’s, thought he.
He went to Kurágin’s.
I bet a hundred on Stevens! shouted one.
Mind, no holding on! cried another.
I bet on Dólokhov! cried a third.
Kurágin, you part our hands.
There, leave Bruin alone; here’s a bet on.
At one draught, or he loses! shouted a fourth.
Wait a bit, you fellows....
Here is Pétya! Good man! cried he, addressing Pierre.
Pierre smiled, looking about him merrily.
I don’t understand.
He was about twenty-five.
The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved.
Dólokhov was a man of small means and no connections.
Dólokhov could play all games and nearly always won.
However much he drank, he never lost his clearheadedness.
The bottle of rum was brought.
Anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window.
He wanted to smash something.
He smashed a pane.
You have a try, Hercules, said he, turning to Pierre.
Is the Englishman bragging?...
Eh? Is it all right? said Anatole.
All were silent.
No, fifty, replied the latter.
Fifty imperials ...
Is that right? Quite right, said the Englishman.
Wait a bit, Kurágin.
Shut up! cried Dólokhov, pushing him away from the window.
Everyone crowded to the window, the Englishman in front.
Pierre stood smiling but silent.
Anatole stopped him.
Anatole stood erect with staring eyes.
The Englishman looked on sideways, pursing up his lips.
All were still.
Pierre took his hands from his eyes.
Why is it so long? thought Pierre.
Suddenly he was aware of a stir all around.
Dólokhov jumped down.
He smelt strongly of rum.
There’s a bet for you!...
Devil take you! came from different sides.
Dólokhov stood frowning and did not speak.
Pierre jumped upon the window sill.
I’ll do it....
What next? Have you gone mad?...
No one would let you!...
No, you’ll never manage him that way, said Anatole.
Wait a bit and I’ll get round him....
Come on then, cried Pierre.
And we’ll take Bruin with us.
It was St.
I’m quite worn out by these callers.
However, I’ll see her and no more.
She is so affected.
Dear Countess, what an age...
She has been laid up, poor child ...
at the Razumóvski’s ball ...
and Countess Apráksina ...
I was so delighted...
and Countess Apráksina...
That’s what comes of a modern education, exclaimed the visitor.
You don’t say so! replied the countess.
He chose his friends badly, interposed Anna Mikháylovna.
But what have they been up to? asked the countess.
They are regular brigands, especially Dólokhov, replied the visitor.
His children are all illegitimate.
I think Pierre also is illegitimate.
The visitor made a gesture with her hand.
I should think he has a score of them.
I have never seen a handsomer man.
He is very much altered now, said Anna Mikháylovna.
Besides, Cyril Vladímirovich is my mother’s second cousin.
Prince Vasíli arrived in Moscow yesterday.
So do come and dine with us! he said.
CHAPTER XI Silence ensued.
Ah, here she is! he exclaimed laughing.
My pet, whose name day it is.
You spoil her, Ilyá, she added, turning to her husband.
What a charming child, she added, addressing the mother.
Do you see?...
She did not reply, but looked at her seriously.
Nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression.
Nicholas blushed when he entered the drawing room.
He evidently tried to find something to say, but failed.
Having said this he glanced at Natásha.
Borís did not laugh.
My dear, there’s friendship for you, he repeated.
He’s joining the hussars.
The visitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head.
All right, all right! said the old count.
The elders began talking about Bonaparte.
Julie Karágina turned to young Rostóv.
What a pity you weren’t at the Arkhárovs’ on Thursday.
All Nicholas’ animation vanished.
Cousinage—dangereux voisinage, * she added.
* Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.
It all depends on the bringing up, remarked the visitor.
Yes, you’re quite right, continued the countess.
Just fancy: wants to be an hussar.
Oh no, not at all too young! replied the count.
And she’s in love with Borís already.
With her elder sister I was stricter.
Natásha was about to call him but changed her mind.
Let him look for me, thought she.
She was experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure.
It opened and Nicholas came in.
It’s nothing, nothing; leave me alone! sobbed Sónya.
Ah, I know what it is.
Sónya did not pull it away, and left off crying.
What will happen now? thought she.
And I will prove it to you.
I don’t like you to talk like that.
I have something to tell you.
Borís followed her, smiling.
What is the something? asked he.
Kiss the doll, said she.
Closer, closer! she whispered.
Natásha, he said, you know that I love you, but....
You are in love with me? Natásha broke in.
In another four years ...
then I will ask for your hand.
Settled! replied Borís.
Forever? said the little girl.
With you I will be quite frank, said Anna Mikháylovna.
Anna Mikháylovna looked at Véra and paused.
The countess pressed her friend’s hand.
She stopped and smiled scornfully.
Sónya and Natásha looked at Véra with guilty, happy faces.
Very silly, said Véra.
I am ashamed of you.
We don’t interfere with you and Berg.
Natálya Ilyníchna behaves very well to me, remarked Borís.
I have nothing to complain of.
Let’s go to the nursery.
In the drawing room the conversation was still going on.
That lawsuit taught me much.
I don’t mind what they think of me.
There’s no one to interest himself for him.
To whom did you apply? To Prince Vasíli.
He was so kind.
Has Prince Vasíli aged much? asked the countess.
I expect he has forgotten me.
His position has not turned his head at all.
She took out her handkerchief and began to cry.
I am in such a state....
My only hope now is in Count Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov.
I shall not be able to equip him.
that tremendous fortune...
Surely he will leave something to Borís, said the countess.
The princess rose.
It’s now two o’clock and you dine at four.
There will just be time.
Be sure to invite him, my dear.
We will see how Tarás distinguishes himself today.
answered her son coldly.
that’s why I have come...
I am a relation.
I shall not disturb him, my friend...
This was the celebrated Petersburg doctor, Lorrain.
Then it is certain? said the prince.
Prince, humanum est errare, * but...
* To err is human.
Very well, very well...
Borís bowed politely.
Is it possible? exclaimed Anna Mikháylovna.
Oh, how awful! It is terrible to think....
This is my son, she added, indicating Borís.
He wanted to thank you himself.
Borís bowed again politely.
I am glad....
They give little hope, replied the prince.
Prince Vasíli became thoughtful and frowned.
They are still young....
I am used to suffering.
Let us wait until evening.
The doctors are expecting a crisis.
Ah, it is awful: the duties of a Christian...
Prince Vasíli turned to her.
They ask him to dinner.
He shrugged his shoulders.
The story told about him at Count Rostóv’s was true.
How do you do, cousin? said Pierre.
Can I see the count? Pierre again asked.
Olga went out.
You will let me know when I can see him.
Yes, it seems he is ill.
Ah, Count Rostóv! exclaimed Pierre joyfully.
It’s such an age...
I am Borís, son of Princess Anna Mikháylovna Drubetskáya.
Rostóv, the father, is Ilyá, and his son is Nicholas.
I never knew any Madame Jacquot.
Well, now we know where we are.
I think the expedition is quite feasible.
Moscow is chiefly busy with gossip, he continued.
Just now they are talking about you and your father.
Yes, it is all very horrid, interrupted Pierre, very horrid.
Well, this is strange! Do you suppose I...
who could think?...
I know very well...
But Borís again interrupted him.
I am glad I have spoken out fully.
I always make it a rule to speak out...
Of course you don’t know me.
We have not met for such a long time...
not since we were children.
You might think that I...
I understand, quite understand.
I am very glad to have made your acquaintance.
He has not sent for me....
A footman came in to summon Borís—the princess was going.
Prince Vasíli saw the princess off.
I will come and spend the night.
He must not be left like this.
Every moment is precious.
I can’t think why his nieces put it off.
Adieu, Prince! May God support you...
Adieu, ma bonne, answered Prince Vasíli turning away from her.
He hardly recognizes anybody.
Oh, Heaven! How ill he is! exclaimed the mother.
At last she rang.
I am very sorry, ma’am, answered the maid.
Ask the count to come to me.
The thousand rubles I paid for Tarás were not ill-spent.
What are your commands, little countess? You see, my dear...
What’s that mess? she said, pointing to his waistcoat.
It’s the sauté, most likely, she added with a smile.
Well, you see, Count, I want some money.
Her face became sad.
Oh, little countess! ...
and the count began bustling to get out his pocketbook.
Yes, Dmítri, clean ones, please, said the countess, sighing deeply.
When would you like them, your excellency? asked Dmítri.
Allow me to inform you...
I was forgetting...
Give it to the countess.
There is never any ‘impossible’ with him.
That’s a thing I hate! Everything is possible.
But I am in great need of this sum.
Well, my dear? asked the countess.
This is for Borís from me, for his outfit.
Anna Mikháylovna was already embracing her and weeping.
The countess wept too.
But those tears were pleasant to them both.
He seemed to be condescending to his companion.
The count sat between them and listened attentively.
Just consider my own position now, Peter Nikoláevich...
Berg always spoke quietly, politely, and with great precision.
Consider my position, Peter Nikoláevich.
La balance y est...
* So that squares matters.
The count burst out laughing.
Berg smiled joyously.
* Hors d’oeuvres.
You have only lately arrived? the countess asked him.
Oui, madame, replied he, looking around him.
You have not yet seen my husband? Non, madame.
He smiled quite inappropriately.
The countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikháylovna.
The other guests were all conversing with one another.
It was charming...
You are very kind...
was heard on all sides.
The countess rose and went into the ballroom.
Márya Dmítrievna? came her voice from there.
Márya Dmítrievna paused at the door.
Márya Dmítrievna always spoke in Russian.
Come here, my friend...
and she ominously tucked up her sleeves still higher.
A fine lad! My word! A fine lad!...
Berg gave his arm to Véra.
The smiling Julie Karágina went in with Nicholas.
or Rhine wine as the case might be.
He resented Shinshín’s remark.
Zat, my dear sir, is vy...
*(4) I just ask you that.
And ve must discuss it as little as po-o-ossible...
he dwelt particularly on the word possible...
as po-o-ossible, he ended, again turning to the count.
Pierre listened to the colonel’s speech and nodded approvingly.
That’s fine, said he.
It is all in God’s hands.
Her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution.
The conversation was hushed.
The countess tried to frown, but could not.
Márya Dmítrievna shook her fat finger.
Cossack! she said threateningly.
You had better take care! said the countess.
Sónya and fat little Pétya doubled up with laughter.
Ice pudding, but you won’t get any, said Márya Dmítrievna.
Before the ices, champagne was served round.
Julie by general request played first.
What shall we sing? she said.
‘The Brook,’ suggested Nicholas.
Well, then, let’s be quick.
Borís, come here, said Natásha.
Sónya! What is it? What is the matter?...
Nicholas is going away in a week’s time, his...
he told me himself...
no one can understand...
It’s all very well for you...
I am not envious...
there are no difficulties in your way....
But Nicholas is my cousin...
one would have to...
the Metropolitan himself...
and even then it can’t be done.
You see how he’s been with her all day...
Natásha, what have I done to deserve it?...
And again she began to sob, more bitterly than before.
And we are only second cousins, you know.
And Borís says it is quite possible.
You know I have told him all about it.
And he is so clever and so good! said Natásha.
Natásha kissed her on the hair.
Sónya sat up.
Do you think so?...
Really? Truly? she said, quickly smoothing her frock and hair.
Natásha blushed and laughed.
The count danced well and knew it.
The dance grew livelier and livelier.
All were watching the count and Márya Dmítrievna.
The doctors pronounced recovery impossible.
The magnificent reception room was crowded.
The limits of human life ...
How young-looking he is! Yes, and he is over sixty.
I hear the count no longer recognizes anyone.
They wished to administer the sacrament of unction.
I knew someone who received that sacrament seven times.
Yes, indeed, replied the princess with a sigh.
So he may have something to drink? Lorrain considered.
Has he taken his medicine? Yes.
The doctor glanced at his watch.
And what a well-preserved man he was! remarked the aide-de-camp.
It von’t go begging, replied the German with a smile.
The German doctor went up to Lorrain.
A small dog began to bark.
Has anything happened? she asked.
I am so terrified.
No, there is no change.
Well, sit down: let’s have a talk.
Prince Vasíli understood it as an expression of weariness.
One must think of the future, of all of you...
in short, the fact is...
He has made wills enough! quietly remarked the princess.
But he cannot leave the estate to Pierre.
Pierre is illegitimate.
Pierre will get everything as the legitimate son.
* A bastard.
* And all that follows therefrom.
That would be a fine thing! said she.
I never wanted anything and I don’t now.
It’s splendid! Fine! I don’t want anything, Prince.
Yes, but you are not the only one.
There are your sisters...
replied Prince Vasíli.
But the princess did not listen to him.
Yes, I knew it long ago but had forgotten.
She gave her companion an angry glance.
There is still time, my dear.
In this world one has to be cunning and cruel.
Now come, come! Be reasonable.
I know your excellent heart.
No, I have a wicked heart.
I know your heart, repeated the prince.
You must know.
I came simply to help him and you.
That’s not the point, my dear.
I’d better go to my own room.
Anna Mikháylovna paused and waited for him to come up.
Think that he is your father ...
perhaps in the agony of death.
I have loved you like a son from the first.
Trust yourself to me, Pierre.
I shall not forget your interests.
This door led into a back anteroom.
Be a man, my friend.
Courage, courage, my friend! He has asked to see you.
That is well! and he turned to go.
But Pierre thought it necessary to ask: How is...
He had another stroke about half an hour ago.
Courage, my friend...
The dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before.
Catch hold from underneath.
Anna Mikháylovna touched Pierre’s hand and said, Come.
He lay with his head propped high on the pillows.
Anna Mikháylovna nodded approvingly.
The eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience.
Pierre rose to help him.
Let us go.
Pierre went out.
Pierre went with Anna Mikháylovna into the small drawing room.
Now this same room was dimly lighted by two candles.
You know how fond the count is of her.
The princess did not reply.
Pierre, my dear, come here.
Prince Vasíli rose.
The princess let go.
And you too! But Anna Mikháylovna did not obey him.
Let go, I tell you! I will take the responsibility.
I myself will go and ask him, I!...
You don’t know what you are doing.
Prince Vasíli bent his head and spread out his hands.
What are you doing! she cried vehemently.
The eldest princess and Prince Vasíli, recovering themselves, followed her.
At sight of Pierre her expression showed an irrepressible hatred.
Prince Vasíli came next.
All will end in death, all! Death is awful...
and he burst into tears.
Anna Mikháylovna came out last.
She approached Pierre with slow, quiet steps.
Pierre! she said.
Pierre gave her an inquiring look.
Then after a pause she said: He is no more....
Pierre looked at her over his spectacles.
Come, I will go with you.
Try to weep, nothing gives such relief as tears.
The will has not yet been opened.
Pierre was silent.
But he had no time.
It is painful, but it does one good.
Through the door came the regular hum of a lathe.
She paused at the entrance.
The princess bent over the exercise book on the table.
She took it quickly and bent her head over it.
The princess gave a wrong answer.
He drew up his chair, and continued to explain.
It will drive all the nonsense out of your head.
Religious! I don’t interfere with anyone’s belief...
I have looked at it.
Well, now go.
The princess was as untidy as her father was tidy.
It reflected a weak, ungraceful figure and thin face.
That is still too fresh.
But enough of gossip.
I embrace you as I love you.
You complain of our separation.
Let us rather read the Epistles and Gospels.
He is in a very bad humor, very morose.
He will get up in twenty minutes.
Let us go across to Mary’s room, he said.
Prince Andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression.
No, no, please not...
You are Mademoiselle Bourienne, said the little princess, kissing her.
I know you already through my sister-in-law’s friendship for you.
The little princess entered the room.
Mademoiselle Bourienne also began to cry.
Ah! my dear!...
they suddenly exclaimed, and then laughed.
I dreamed last night...—You were not expecting us?...
Ah! Mary, you have got thinner?...
And you have grown stouter!...
I knew the princess at once, put in Mademoiselle Bourienne.
And I had no idea!...
exclaimed Princess Mary.
Ah, Andrew, I did not see you.
Lise sighed too.
Yes, and even tomorrow, replied her brother.
Is it certain? she said.
The face of the little princess changed.
She sighed and said: Yes, quite certain.
Ah! it is very dreadful...
Her lip descended.
She needs rest, said Prince Andrew with a frown.
How is he? Just the same? Yes, just the same.
Thank God, said his son smiling.
The house for your wife is ready.
That’s their woman’s way! I am glad to have her.
Sit down and talk.
About Mikhelson’s army I understand—Tolstóy’s too...
a simultaneous expedition....
But what’s the southern army to do? Prussia is neutral...
I know that.
Dieu sait quand reviendra.
His son only smiled.
Go to the dining room.
Princess Mary looked at her brother in surprise.
She did not understand what he was laughing at.
Everyone has his Achilles’ heel, continued Prince Andrew.
A footman moved the chair for her.
You’ve been in a hurry.
She was silent and seemed confused.
Consider, Prince Andrew.
Frederick and Suvórov; Moreau!...
May God help you, but we’ll see what will happen.
Buonaparte has become a great commander among them! Hm!...
To be sure, your excellency, replied the architect.
The prince again laughed his frigid laugh.
Buonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth.
He has got splendid soldiers.
Besides he began by attacking Germans.
And only idlers have failed to beat the Germans.
Since the world began everybody has beaten the Germans.
They beat no one—except one another.
He made his reputation fighting them.
But it troubles me.
I don’t sleep at night.
That would take too long to tell, answered the son.
Oh, he is so kind! answered Princess Mary.
CHAPTER XXVIII Prince Andrew was to leave next evening.
The little princess was in her sister-in-law’s room.
Prince Andrew’s face looked very thoughtful and tender.
She smiled as she uttered his pet name, Andrúsha.
She is quite a child: such a dear, merry child.
I have grown so fond of her.
We should enter into everyone’s situation.
Tout comprendre, c’est tout pardonner.
* To understand all is to forgive all.
There is only Mademoiselle Bourienne....
She has no one, no one.
I like being alone....
Father likes her very much.
She reads to him in the evenings and reads splendidly.
For me? For me?...
Trying for me!...
Her brother shook his head incredulously.
The only thing that is hard for me...
I will tell you the truth, Andrew...
is Father’s way of treating religious subjects.
That is the only thing that makes me unhappy.
She looked timidly at her brother.
Even if it were a great deal of trouble...
answered Prince Andrew, as if guessing what it was about.
To please you...
said Prince Andrew.
Please, Andrew, for my sake!...
Rays of gentle light shone from her large, timid eyes.
Andrew understood, crossed himself and kissed the icon.
Thank you, my dear.
They were silent for a while.
Don’t judge Lise harshly, she began.
And I am sorry for that, he went on.
The patches grew deeper on her forehead, neck, and cheeks.
She tried to say something but could not.
After crying she had fallen asleep.
Prince Andrew felt sorry for his sister.
But if you want to know the truth...
Let us go to her, I must say good-by.
Or—go and wake and I’ll come in a moment.
Put this on the seat and this to the right.
Well, maybe! said Prince Andrew.
Go, Másha; I’ll come immediately.
He entered the room softly.
She answered him and continued her chatter.
The coach with six horses was waiting at the porch.
Servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch.
All were waiting for them to come out.
He glanced round.
Going? And he went on writing.
I’ve come to say good-by.
The Service before everything.
If you have anything to say, say it.
These two things can be done together, he added.
About my wife...
Why talk nonsense? Say what you want.
Let him be here....
They have been telling her things.
She has had a dream and is frightened.
I’ll do it.
I don’t understand! said Prince Andrew.
No, it can’t be helped, lad, said the prince.
They’re all like that; one can’t unmarry.
What’s to be done? She’s pretty! I will do everything.
Now listen! Give this letter to Michael Ilariónovich.
Write and tell me how he receives you.
If he is all right—serve him.
Now come here.
I shall probably die before you.
Send it to the Academy.
You will find them useful.
He felt that he must not say it.
I will do it all, Father, he said.
The old man was silent.
let him grow up with you....
They stood silent, facing one another.
We’ve said good-by.
Prince Andrew sighed and made no reply.
Well! he said, turning to his wife.
He embraced her.
She screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder.
Braunau was the headquarters of the commander in chief, Kutúzov.
It was the state of the soldiers’ boots.
More than half the men’s boots were in holes.
We had our hands full last night.
What? asked the commander.
They were an aide-de-camp followed by a Cossack.
A fine mess we’ve made of it! he remarked.
Oh, my God! he added, stepping resolutely forward.
Company commanders! he shouted in a voice accustomed to command.
In an hour’s time, I should say.
Whatever is this? This! he shouted and stood still.
commander to the general...
third company to the commander.
Your excellency, you gave him leave yourself, on the march.
One says a word to you and you...
Why a blue coat? Off with it...
Sergeant major! Change his coat...
he did not finish.
Dólokhov hurriedly interrupted.
No talking in the ranks!...
The eyes of the general and the soldier met.
The general became silent, angrily pulling down his tight scarf.
CHAPTER II He’s coming! shouted the signaler at that moment.
The calèche stopped in front of the regiment.
The regiment roared, Health to your ex...
lency! and again all became silent.
There were only 217 sick and stragglers.
Everything was in good order except the boots.
These gentlemen talked among themselves and sometimes laughed.
This was Prince Bolkónski.
On reaching the third company he suddenly stopped.
Another Ismail comrade, said he.
He used to have a predilection for Bacchus.
Kutúzov turned round.
Where is Dólokhov? asked Kutúzov.
This is Dólokhov, said Prince Andrew.
Ah! said Kutúzov.
I hope this will be a lesson to you.
Do your duty.
He turned away and went to the carriage.
it can’t be helped...
one is sometimes a bit hasty on parade...
I am the first to apologize, you know me!...
And tell Mr.
Dólokhov that I won’t forget him—he may be quite easy.
And what about his character? asked the regimental commander.
It’s different on different days, answered the captain.
In Poland, if you please, he nearly killed a Jew.
Oh, well, well! remarked the regimental commander.
You know he has important connections...
Well, then, you just...
Well, that’s all right, continued the regimental commander.
In a word, a hearty one...
The company marched on gaily.
The soldiers’ voices could be heard on every side.
Boots and leg bands...
he noticed everything...
When he looked at my feet, friend...
well, thinks I...
I say, Fédeshon!...
Everybody said that Buonaparte himself was at Braunau.
The Austrians, you see, are putting them down.
And here, friend, the people are quite beggarly.
Singers to the front came the captain’s order.
Kutúzov and his suite were returning to the town.
How am I? Dólokhov answered coldly.
I am as you see.
They are good fellows.
Both were silent.
Is it true that Austrians have been beaten? asked Dólokhov.
The devil only knows! They say so.
Why, have you too much money? Do come.
I’ve sworn not to.
I won’t drink and won’t play till I get reinstated.
Well, that’s only till the first engagement.
We shall see.
They were again silent.
Come if you need anything.
One can at least be of use on the staff...
And I only...
It’s a long, long way.
To my native land...
I should long ago have joined the archduke.
But circumstances are sometimes too strong for us, General.
And that is the whole point.
Kutúzov bowed with the same smile.
The general frowned.
Give me that letter, said Kutúzov turning to Prince Andrew.
He involuntarily looked round at the aide-de-camp.
Excuse me, General, interrupted Kutúzov, also turning to Prince Andrew.
Well, Prince? asked Kozlóvski.
And why is it? Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders.
Any news from Mack? No.
Probably, said Prince Andrew moving toward the outer door.
Prince Andrew stopped short.
The commander in chief is engaged, repeated Kozlóvski calmly.
The general’s face clouded, his lips quivered and trembled.
There’s nothing to be gay about, answered Bolkónski.
He screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening.
I have the honor to congratulate you.
The general frowned, turned away, and went on.
What’s the matter? I only congratulated them, said Zherkóv.
Yes, your excellency, answered the Ukrainian gaily, tossing his head.
Hasn’t been in since the evening.
Must have been losing, answered Lavrúshka.
Will you have coffee? Yes, bring some.
Ten minutes later Lavrúshka brought the coffee.
He’s coming! said he.
He came up to the porch gloomily, hanging his head.
Ah, you’re up already, said Denísov, entering the room.
Weally! And I’ve been losing, bwother.
Such ill luck! Such ill luck.
As soon as you left, it began and went on.
If we could only get to fighting soon.
The squadron quartermaster! said Lavrúshka.
Denísov’s face puckered still more.
Where? At Bykov’s, at the rat’s...
Well, young cavalryman, how is my Rook behaving? he asked.
I saw you riding this morning...
The hoof’s cracked! That’s nothing.
Yes, please do, said Rostóv.
I’ll show you, I’ll show you! It’s not a secret.
And it’s a horse you’ll thank me for.
Let us go ourselves.
I only came round to ask Denísov about yesterday’s order.
Have you got it, Denísov? Not yet.
They went through the porch and into the stable.
We are childwen of the dust...
Who should it be? You yourself told him to come.
It’s the quartermaster for the money.
Wetched business, he muttered to himself.
Seven new and three old imperials.
Really I have some, Rostóv repeated.
No, I tell you.
Where have you put it, Wostóv? Under the lower pillow.
It’s not there.
Denísov threw both pillows on the floor.
The purse was not there.
That’s a miwacle.
He pulled off the quilt and shook it.
The purse was not there.
I put it just here.
Where is it? he asked, turning to Lavrúshka.
I haven’t been in the room.
It must be where you put it.
But it isn’t?...
Feel in your pockets.
Wostóv, you’ve not been playing schoolboy twicks...
He could not draw breath.
It must be here somewhere, said Lavrúshka.
You are mad, I tell you.
I won’t allow it.
There was no one else in the room except myself.
So that if it is not so, then...
He could not finish, and ran out of the room.
Rostóv went to Telyánin’s quarters.
You’ve only just missed him, said the orderly.
Both were silent.
Please be quick, he said.
The coin was a new one.
Rostóv rose and went up to Telyánin.
Yes, it’s a nice purse.
Well, let me have it, young man, I’m going.
Rostóv did not speak.
Now then, let me have it.
Rostóv let go of it.
That money is Denísov’s; you took it...
he whispered just above Telyánin’s ear.
What? What? How dare you? What? said Telyánin.
We must have an explanation...
I know it and shall prove it, said Rostóv.
Don’t ruin a young fellow...
here is this wretched money, take it...
He threw it on the table.
I have an old father and mother!...
said Telyánin drawing nearer to him.
Don’t touch me, said Rostóv, drawing back.
And there it rests.
That’s all right.
Not on any account! exclaimed Rostóv.
That’s twue, devil take it! shouted Denísov, jumping up.
No, gentlemen, no...
you mustn’t think...
I quite understand.
You’re wrong to think that of me...
for the honor of the regiment I’d...
Well, what else do you want?...
I tell you, shouted Denísov, he’s a fine fellow.
Go and apologize, your excellency.
Yes, go! Gentlemen, I’ll do anything.
It’ll be worse for you.
Well, it’s as you like, said the staff captain.
And what has become of that scoundrel? he asked Denísov.
Illness or not, he’d better not cwoss my path.
I’d kill him! shouted Denísov in a bloodthirsty tone.
Just then Zherkóv entered the room.
An Austrian general complained of me.
I congratulated him on Mack’s arrival...
They were under orders to advance next day.
It was a warm, rainy, autumnal day.
They’ll ransack that castle, he remarked with evident approval.
So they will, said Nesvítski.
That would be fine, gentlemen! The officers laughed.
Just to flutter the nuns a bit.
They say there are Italian girls among them.
Nesvítski rose, puffing, and went up to the general, smiling.
Would not your excellency like a little refreshment? he said.
Hadn’t I better ride over, your excellency? asked Nesvítski.
Very good, answered Nesvítski.
Now then, let’s see how far it will carry, Captain.
Just try! said the general, turning to an artillery officer.
Have a little fun to pass the time.
Crew, to your guns! commanded the officer.
One! came the command.
Number one jumped briskly aside.
Hi there, boys! Keep to the left! Wait a bit.
And he also passed on with the wagon.
Then came some merry soldiers who had evidently been drinking.
Yes, the ham was just delicious...
answered another with a loud laugh.
Bah! How they scurry.
That one also passed.
Then followed a cart unlike any that had gone before.
Evidently these fugitives were allowed to pass by special permission.
The girl smiled and took it.
something big, that splashed into the water.
Encouraging us to get along quicker, said another uneasily.
The crowd moved on again.
Nesvítski realized that it was a cannon ball.
Hey, Cossack, my horse! he said.
Ah, Váska! joyfully replied Nesvítski.
Let us pass!...
They keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day.
If they mean to fight, let’s fight.
But the devil knows what this is.
Smart lads! Only fit for a fair! said one.
These were the French.
The hussars began carefully aligning their horses.
Silence fell on the whole squadron.
A second and a third cannon ball flew past.
Cadet Mirónov ducked every time a ball flew past.
He rode up to Kírsten.
Well, what about it? said he to Denísov.
It won’t come to a fight.
You’ll see—we shall retire.
The devil only knows what they’re about! muttered Denísov.
And he smiled approvingly, evidently pleased with the cadet.
Rostóv felt perfectly happy.
Just then the commander appeared on the bridge.
Denísov galloped up to him.
Your excellency! Let us attack them! I’ll dwive them off.
An order to who? asked the colonel morosely.
How’s this, Colonel? he shouted as he approached.
The colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to Nesvítski.
How did you get here? said he, turning to Zherkóv.
On the same business.
continued the colonel in an offended tone.
There, it’s just as I thought, said Rostóv to himself.
Let him see whether I am a coward! he thought.
Then came the word of command.
Look sharp! Look sharp! several voices repeated around him.
The men were crossing themselves.
Denísov rode past him, leaning back and shouting something.
Stretchers! shouted someone behind him.
The others outstripped him.
Our Bogdánich knows how things are done.
There now! said the officer of the suite, that’s grapeshot.
Then two reports one after another, and a third.
Look! A man has fallen! Fallen, fallen! Two, I think.
The French guns were hastily reloaded.
Rostóv ran up to him with the others.
There was peace and happiness...
groans, suffering, fear, and this uncertainty and hurry...
Was that grapeshot? he asked Denísov.
Yes and no mistake! cried Denísov.
Well, it seems that no one has noticed, thought Rostóv.
And this was true.
Here’s something for you to report, said Zherkóv.
See if I don’t get promoted to a sublieutenancy.
Day before yesterday, on the Danube, answered the soldier.
Get well soon, lads! he continued, turning to the soldiers.
There’s plenty to do still.
He expected to be at once presented to the Emperor.
He will conduct you to the Minister of War.
From General Field Marshal Kutúzov? he asked.
Oh, my God! My God! Schmidt! he exclaimed in German.
Again he pondered.
I thank you! You must have a rest.
Be at the levee tomorrow after the parade.
However, I will let you know.
Au revoir! Thank you very much.
Bilíbin settled down comfortably beside the fire.
He worked well whatever the import of his work.
His small, deep-set eyes always twinkled and looked out straight.
Well, now tell me about your exploits, said he.
Bilíbin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared.
True, we have no Prater here...
That’s just it, my dear fellow.
The Archduke Karl does nothing, the Archduke Ferdinand disgraces himself.
But Vienna is on the other side.
Well, I think it is.
She will retaliate.
* Fine eyes.
Impossible! cried Prince Andrew.
That would be too base.
He woke up...
CHAPTER XI Next day he woke late.
In the study were four gentlemen of the diplomatic corps.
Bilíbin introduced him to the others.
Can you fancy the figure he cut?...
He began to laugh.
Tell me about that! he said.
Oh, you Don Juan! You serpent! cried several voices.
* Woman is man’s companion.
Prince Andrew and the others gathered round these two.
as in its last note...
Wait, I have not finished...
That is how it will end.
Everybody laughed, and Hippolyte louder than anyone.
Brünn’s attractions must be shown him.
Where to? To the Emperor.
We’ll take you in hand.
Well, talk as much as you can, anyway.
Tell me, when did the battle begin? he asked hurriedly.
Prince Andrew replied.
At what o’clock did the battle begin? asked the Emperor.
But the Emperor smiled and interrupted him.
Three and a half miles, Your Majesty.
The Emperor interrupted him.
Everywhere he saw friendly looks and heard friendly words.
The Empress’ chamberlain invited him to see Her Majesty.
The archduchess also wished to see him.
What is it? he asked.
Bilíbin came out to meet him.
His usually calm face showed excitement.
There now! Confess that this is delightful, said he.
This affair of the Thabor Bridge, at Vienna....
I heard nothing there.
What is it all about? inquired Prince Andrew impatiently.
No one, not even Bonaparte, knows why.
Bolkónski shrugged his shoulders.
That’s just it, answered Bilíbin.
Listen! The French entered Vienna as I told you.
* The marshalls.
Stop jesting, said Prince Andrew sadly and seriously.
This news grieved him and yet he was pleased.
Stop this jesting, he said.
I am not jesting, Bilíbin went on.
Nothing is truer or sadder.
He lets them enter the tête-de-pont.
Not that either.
c’est du Mack.
Nous sommes mackés (It is...
it is a bit of Mack.
I am going away.
Where to? To the army.
Prince Andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no reply.
I understand that.
You and I will travel comfortably in my calèche.
Do stop joking, Bilíbin, cried Bolkónski.
My dear fellow, you are a hero! said Bilíbin.
The woman screamed piercingly.
For heaven’s sake...
Turn back with your slut! Mr.
Aide-de-camp! Help me!...
What does it all mean? screamed the doctor’s wife.
Kindly let this cart pass.
I’ll teach you to push on!...
This expression evidently pleased him.
Do as you like.
He turned round.
Nesvítski’s handsome face looked out of the little window.
Don’t you hear? Eh? Come quick...
On their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm.
This was particularly noticeable on Nesvítski’s usually laughing countenance.
Where is the commander in chief? asked Bolkónski.
Here, in that house, answered the adjutant.
I was going to ask you.
But sit down and have something to eat.
It’s nothing, replied Prince Andrew.
What is the commander in chief doing here? he asked.
I can’t make out at all, said Nesvítski.
Weyrother was the Austrian general who had succeeded Schmidt.
have you written it? he continued dictating to the clerk.
The Kiev Grenadiers, Podolian...
He turned to Kozlóvski with urgent questions.
Immediately, Prince, said Kozlóvski.
Dispositions for Bagratión.
What about capitulation? Nothing of the sort.
Orders are issued for a battle.
He looked straight at his adjutant’s face without recognizing him.
Well, have you finished? said he to Kozlóvski.
One moment, your excellency.
Ah, from Vienna? Very good.
Later, later! Kutúzov went out into the porch with Bagratión.
Well, good-by, Prince, said he to Bagratión.
Get in with me, said he to Bolkónski.
Your excellency, I should like to be of use here.
Allow me to remain with Prince Bagratión’s detachment.
Kutúzov did not reply.
There was not a trace of agitation on his face.
Kutúzov chose this latter course.
But a freak of fate made the impossible possible.
Break the armistice immediately and march on the enemy.
March on, destroy the Russian army....
The Russian Emperor’s aide-de-camp is an impostor.
The officers don’t keep them in hand.
I must go there, Prince, and scare them a bit.
It won’t take a moment.
They dismounted and entered the tent.
Well, aren’t you ashamed of yourself, Captain Túshin? he continued.
He grew confused.
Prince Andrew glanced again at the artillery officer’s small figure.
* This is a pleasure one gets in camp, Prince.
They rode up the opposite hill.
From there the French could already be seen.
Prince Andrew stopped and began examining the position.
You can see everything from there; let’s go there, Prince.
The man shrieked unnaturally.
Go on, go on! said the major.
Prince Andrew, having reached the front line, rode along it.
Prince Andrew halted to have a look at the French.
There now, Sídorov! Wait a bit and listen.
The soldier to whom the laughers referred was Dólokhov.
They were naturally talking about the campaign.
The French onlookers and listeners laughed.
* On vous fera danser.
Qu’ est-ce qu’il chante? * asked a Frenchman.
began Dólokhov, but the Frenchman interrupted him.
He is the Emperor! Sacré nom...! cried he angrily.
The devil skin your Emperor.
Let us go, Iván Lukích, he said to the captain.
So he reasoned....
That’s so, friend.
One is afraid of the unknown, that’s what it is.
we know there is no sky but only an atmosphere.
The manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer.
He recognized the agreeable, philosophizing voice with pleasure.
Some herb vodka? Certainly! said Túshin.
But still, to conceive a future life...
He did not finish.
The ground seemed to groan at the terrible impact.
The smoke above it had not yet dispersed.
Two mounted Frenchmen, probably adjutants, were galloping up the hill.
Evidently our guns had begun to reply.
It has begun.
Prince Andrew followed with the suite.
A French pancake, answered Zherkóv.
So that’s what they hit with? asked the accountant.
How awful! He seemed to swell with satisfaction.
The Cossack was dead, but the horse still struggled.
Number Two! he squeaked.
The French had advanced nearest on our right.
To the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood.
Very good! said Bagratión.
They began to meet wounded men.
The whole air reeked with smoke.
The excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with it.
A pleasant humming and whistling of bullets were often heard.
They march splendidly, remarked someone in Bagratión’s suite.
The clash would take place on this side of it...
Well done, lads! said Prince Bagratión.
The order was given to halt and down knapsacks.
The French were already near.
Bugler, sount ze retreat! But haste was becoming imperative.
If you vere in the cavalry...
Both passed the examination successfully.
Still no one moved.
Fo’ward, with God, lads! rang out Denísov’s voice.
Shots could be heard, but some way off.
He had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him.
Hur-a-a-a-ah! came a roar of voices.
Ahead, the enemy was already visible.
Bondarchúk’s horse swerved and galloped past.
He was alone in the middle of a field.
There was warm blood under his arm.
No, I am wounded and the horse is killed.
There was no one near.
Having disentangled his leg, he rose.
The wrist felt as if it were not his.
Then came two more, and many more running behind.
One of them said something strange, not in Russian.
It must be one of ours, a prisoner.
No, there’s some mistake, thought he.
They can’t have wanted to kill me.
He could run no more.
The Frenchman also stopped and took aim.
Rostóv closed his eyes and stooped down.
One bullet and then another whistled past him.
Behind these were some Russian sharpshooters.
Surrounded! Cut off? We’re lost! shouted the fugitives.
Everything seemed lost.
He had an officer’s sword in his hand.
I have taken an officer prisoner.
I stopped the company.
Dólokhov breathed heavily from weariness and spoke in abrupt sentences.
The whole company can bear witness.
A bayonet wound.
I remained at the front.
Grand! The fire, fanned by the breeze, was rapidly spreading.
His face grew more and more animated.
On the contrary, he became more and more elated.
Now look out for the ball...
we’ll throw it back.
only a shell...
Come along, our Matvévna! he said to himself.
* Daughter of Matthew.
Ah! Breathing again, breathing! he muttered to himself.
he muttered, holding up two fingers to his cap.
He turned his horse and galloped off.
Retire! All to retire! he shouted from a distance.
The soldiers laughed.
A moment later, an adjutant arrived with the same order.
It was Prince Andrew.
Blood was gushing from its leg as from a spring.
Among the limbers lay several dead men.
But the mere thought of being afraid roused him again.
He delivered the order and did not leave the battery.
Not like your honor! Prince Andrew said nothing to Túshin.
Well, till we meet again...
he said, holding out his hand to Túshin.
Good-by, my dear fellow, said Túshin.
For God’s sake...
I can’t walk.
He asked in a hesitating, piteous voice.
He died, replied someone.
Help him up.
The cadet was Rostóv.
No, it’s a sprain.
Flashes of shot gleamed in the darkness.
Not hurt, Petróv? asked one.
You couldn’t see a thing.
Fires were lighted and the talk became more audible.
Rostóv, too, dragged himself to the fire.
You don’t mind your honor? he asked Túshin.
I’ve lost my company, your honor.
I don’t know where...
After he had gone, two soldiers rushed to the campfire.
You picked it up?...
Must one die like a dog? said he.
Túshin told them to give the man some water.
One of them stumbled.
He’s dead—why carry him? said another.
Still aching? Túshin asked Rostóv in a whisper.
Your honor, you’re wanted by the general.
Our officers were flocking in to look at him.
They broke up two squares, your excellency.
All were silent.
Several of those present laughed.
The officers’ laughter confused him still more.
I had no men...
You might have taken some from the covering troops.
The silence lasted some time.
Prince Andrew went out with him.
Thank you; you saved me, my dear fellow! said Túshin.
He felt sad and depressed.
The pain in his arm became more and more intense.
To rid himself of them he closed his eyes.
He opened his eyes and looked up.
Flakes of falling snow were fluttering in that light.
Túshin had not returned, the doctor had not come.
Nobody wants me! thought Rostóv.
There is no one to help me or pity me.
Yet I was once at home, strong, happy, and loved.
He sighed and, doing so, groaned involuntarily.
And why did I come here? he wondered.
She could not refrain from weeping at these words.
I am very glad.
Here is something I have received from the chancellor.
The diplomatic career now lies open before you.
Prince Vasíli sighed.
Yes, yes, my boy.
And my valet can go in your carriage.
Ah! I was nearly forgetting, he added.
We’ll go into the accounts later.
Now everything Pierre said was charmant.
Pierre felt flattered by this.
Another group was at the tea table.
Go and keep her company for ten minutes.
She was terribly close to him.
That’s a good thing, but don’t move from Prince Vasíli’s.
I know something about that.
Don’t I? And you are still so young.
You need advice.
Pierre did not look at Hélène nor she at him.
But she was just as terribly close to him.
He muttered something and colored.
What had happened? Nothing.
But she’s stupid.
I have myself said she is stupid, he thought.
Hippolyte is her brother...
Prince Vasíli is her father...
The day after tomorrow will be Lëlya’s name day.
I am her father.
The visitors were seated at supper.
He enlivened the whole party.
From all sides...
From all sides...
From all sides...
and then tears, someone repeated laughing.
Everybody laughed a great deal.
it’s getting on, it will all be settled today.
He was like a man entirely absorbed in some occupation.
He did not see, hear, or understand anything clearly.
So it is all finished! he thought.
Then there was nothing.
How absent-minded you are, my dear fellow.
Yes, from Olmütz, he answered, with a sigh.
Oh, the old fool, he thought.
That Princess Hélène will be beautiful still when she’s fifty.
If I hadn’t this headache I’d have stayed longer.
Some of the nearest relatives had not yet left.
They were sitting in the large drawing room.
Prince Vasíli came up to Pierre with languid footsteps.
Pierre rose and said it was getting late.
And he again turned to Pierre.
He suddenly muttered something and went away.
It seemed to Pierre that even the prince was disconcerted.
Marriages are made in heaven, replied the elderly lady.
He closed his eyes and seemed to be dozing.
His head sank forward and then he roused himself.
Pierre and Hélène still sat talking just as before.
Still the same, she said to her husband.
With quick steps he went joyfully up to Pierre.
Thank God! said Prince Vasíli.
I am very pleased.
(His voice trembled.) I loved your father...
and she will make you a good wife...
God bless you!...
Tears actually moistened his cheeks.
Princess, come here! he shouted.
The old princess came in and also wept.
The elderly lady was using her handkerchief too.
After a while they were left alone again.
Hélène! he said aloud and paused.
He looked at her face.
She drew nearer to him.
Her face flushed.
Oh, take those off...
she said, pointing to his spectacles.
Her face struck Pierre, by its altered, unpleasantly excited expression.
* I love you.
Prince Nicholas frowned, but said nothing.
He snorted whenever he mentioned him.
Stepping flat on his heels—we know what that means....
The snow is deep.
I am having the avenue swept, your honor.
shouted the prince rapidly.
The prince looked at his daughter’s frightened face and snorted.
or dummy! he muttered.
And the other one is not here.
Where is the princess? he asked.
It is natural in her state.
Hm! Hm! muttered the prince, sitting down.
Tíkhon caught it and handed it to a footman.
Hm!—his excellency is a puppy....
Why his son is coming I don’t understand.
Perhaps Princess Elizabeth and Princess Mary know.
I don’t want him.
After dinner, he went to see his daughter-in-law.
She grew pale on seeing her father-in-law.
She was much altered.
She was now plain rather than pretty.
Do you want anything? No, merci, mon père.
Well, all right, all right.
Has the snow been shoveled back? Yes, your excellency.
Forgive me for heaven’s sake...
It was only my stupidity.
Prince Vasíli arrived that evening.
Prince Vasíli and Anatole had separate rooms assigned to them.
You have a maroon dress, have it fetched.
No, Mary, really this dress does not suit you.
I prefer you in your little gray everyday dress.
Now please, do it for my sake.
No, leave me alone, said Princess Mary.
At least, change your coiffure, said the little princess.
Not in the least! Please change it.
You will change it, won’t you? said Lise.
Princess Mary was left alone.
Please come to tea.
A painful doubt filled her soul.
Then Anatole came up to her.
She still could not see him.
* * The little one is charming.
The coming of these visitors annoyed him.
And why should she marry? he thought.
To be unhappy for certain.
His birth and position in society were not bad.
And that is what we shall see.
Here is my second son; please love and befriend him.
Prince Bolkónski surveyed Anatole.
Fine young fellow! Fine young fellow! he said.
Well, come and kiss me, and he offered his cheek.
Then rising, he suddenly went up to his daughter.
Ah! That’s a good thing.
Such a fine fellow must serve.
Suddenly Prince Bolkónski frowned.
You may go, he said to Anatole.
Anatole returned smiling to the ladies.
Yes, everything is different nowadays, everything is changed.
He can stay and I’ll see.
The old prince snorted.
You know, you see right through people.
Princess Mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure.
He seemed to her kind, brave, determined, manly, and magnanimous.
She felt convinced of that.
She drove them away and tried to conceal them.
Poor girl, she’s devilish ugly! thought Anatole.
And now he, a real Russian prince, had appeared.
Princess Mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion.
How she loves me! thought Princess Mary.
What delicacy! thought the princess.
Anatole went up to kiss the little princess’ hand.
Not till then! she said.
The old prince did not sleep either.
Tíkhon, half asleep, heard him pacing angrily about and snorting.
No, she has no pride...
but I’ll let her see....
I never invited them.
Gone to bed? asked the prince.
Princess Mary well knew this painstaking expression of her father’s.
He came to the point at once, treating her ceremoniously.
How understand me! cried her father angrily.
That’s how it’s to be understood! ‘How understand it’!...
I’m not going to get married.
What about you? That’s what I want to know.
She had no time to finish.
The old prince interrupted her.
That’s admirable! he shouted.
She’ll be the wife, while you...
The prince stopped.
Now then, now then, I’m only joking! he said.
I give you freedom.
Only remember that your life’s happiness depends on your decision.
I know you will pray over it.
Her fate was decided and happily decided.
Princess Mary looked at them in silence.
She could not understand it.
At last Mademoiselle Bourienne gave a scream and ran away.
But you despise me.
Oh, only my poor mother...
I quite understand, answered Princess Mary, with a sad smile.
Calm yourself, my dear.
He hurriedly took a pinch of snuff.
snorted Prince Bolkónski.
Prince Vasíli rose.
The future is so long.
Very glad! Go back to your rooms, Princess.
Go! said the old prince.
My vocation is a different one, thought Princess Mary.
I shall be so happy when she is his wife.
thought Princess Mary.
The count sobbed yet more.
my darling boy...
promoted to be an officer...
Anna Mikháylovna shook her head.
You are a little slyboots, she said.
a letter, she announced in gleeful triumph.
Nicholas! was all Sónya said, instantly turning white.
She rushed to Sónya, hugged her, and began to cry.
You are all blubberers and understand nothing.
Natásha smiled through her tears.
You haven’t read the letter? asked Sónya.
Thank God! said Sónya, crossing herself.
But perhaps she deceived you.
Let us go to Mamma.
Pétya paced the room in silence for a time.
I remember Nikólenka too, I remember him well, she said.
But I don’t remember Borís.
I don’t remember him a bit.
What! You don’t remember Borís? asked Sónya in surprise.
Him—I just shut my eyes and remember, but Borís...
No! (She shut her eyes.) No! there’s nothing at all.
But Natásha had not yet felt anything like it.
She believed it could be, but did not understand it.
Shall you write to him? she asked.
Sónya became thoughtful.
And I should be ashamed to write to Borís.
I’m not going to.
Why should you be ashamed? Well, I don’t know.
It’s awkward and would make me ashamed.
And she went in, closing the door behind her.
The count put his ear to the keyhole and listened.
Anna Mikháylovna opened the door.
The countess was crying.
Why are you crying, Mamma? asked Véra.
And who is it she takes after? thought the countess.
And what a soul! Not a word about himself....
He says nothing about his sufferings.
Rostóv had not yet had time to get his uniform.
Berg held a smoking pipe between his knees.
At that moment the door opened.
Here he is at last! shouted Rostóv.
Eh, is she pretty? he asked with a wink.
Why do you shout so? You’ll frighten them! said Borís.
I did not expect you today, he added.
Well, how are you? Been under fire already? asked Borís.
Without answering, Rostóv shook the soldier’s Cross of St.
As you see, he said.
Indeed? Yes, yes! said Borís, with a smile.
And we too have had a splendid march.
And the Tsarévich was very gracious to all our officers.
Oh, you Guards! said Rostóv.
I say, send for some wine.
Borís made a grimace.
If you really want it, said he.
As for us, Count, we get along on our pay.
I can tell you for myself...
Go across to our hosts: they invited you, added Borís.
Why have you thrown that away? asked Borís.
It is some letter of recommendation...
This letter would be of great use to you.
I want nothing, and I won’t be anyone’s adjutant.
Why not? inquired Borís.
Come, how are you? asked Rostóv.
Well, as you see.
Oh, that’s it! said Rostóv, evidently thinking of something else.
Old Gabriel brought in the wine.
Shouldn’t we now send for Berg? asked Borís.
He would drink with you.
Well, send for him...
Again Rostóv looked intently into Borís’ eyes and sighed.
I came forward....
‘Hey, are you dumb?’ he shouted.
Still I remained silent.
That’s what keeping one’s head means.
Yes, that was fine, said Rostóv, smiling.
And so he told them all that.
I am speaking of the staff in general.
The ranks were drawn up on the vast field.
This was the Emperors’ suites.
To Rostóv every word sounded like a voice from heaven.
George’s standards and will be worthy of them.
Oh, to die, to die for him, thought Rostóv.
That hesitation lasted only an instant.
Of course not! he now thought.
Fine fellows, the Pávlograds! remarked the Emperor.
His every word and movement was described with ecstasy.
Bolkónski was not there.
None of these gentlemen changed his position on seeing Borís.
Prince Andrew came up to him and took his hand.
I was fussing about with Germans all day.
We went with Weyrother to survey the dispositions.
He has had a letter from Prince Kurágin about me.
All right, all right.
We’ll talk it over, replied Prince Andrew.
It’s no use your going to the commander in chief.
Everything is now centered round the Emperor.
All the advantages were on our side.
Dolgorúkov smiled significantly.
Is that so? And what did he say? inquired Bolkónski.
What can he say? Tra-di-ri-di-ra and so on...
merely to gain time.
That’s just it, interrupted Dolgorúkov quickly, laughing.
You know Bilíbin—he’s a very clever fellow.
Only that? said Bolkónski.
He is a wise and clever fellow.
What was it? To the Head of the French Government...
Au chef du gouvernement français, said Dolgorúkov, with grave satisfaction.
Delightful! said Bolkónski.
But you see...
Who was that? asked Borís.
Come here, Wostóv.
The officers gathered round Denísov’s canteen, eating and talking.
Sell us that horse! Denísov called out to the Cossacks.
Rostóv smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him money.
The Emperor! The Emperor! was suddenly heard among the hussars.
In a moment everyone was in his place, waiting.
The Pávlograd hussars? he inquired.
A gentle, mild light poured from them.
The soldier groaned.
The hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shouts.
Denísov, don’t make fun of it! cried Rostóv.
It is such a lofty, beautiful feeling, such a...
This officer was Savary.
The fete is for tomorrow.
Yes, you have seen him? said Prince Andrew.
All eventualities have been foreseen.
If he is standing before Brünn...
Be quiet, backbiter! said Dolgorúkov.
He really was asleep.
The dispositions were very complicated and difficult.
For this object it is necessary that...
The first column marches...
The second column marches...
The third column marches...
and so on, read Weyrother.
The generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositions.
Then Milorádovich looked round significantly at the other generals.
Weyrother complied and Dohktúrov noted them down.
So you think he is powerless? said Langeron.
How is that?...
But before a battle, there is nothing more important...
he paused, than to have a good sleep.
He moved as if to rise.
The generals bowed and retired.
It was past midnight.
Prince Andrew went out.
Yes, tomorrow, tomorrow! he thought.
But death and suffering? suggested another voice.
The next battle is won by him alone.
Kutúzov is removed and he is appointed...
Well and then? asked the other voice.
Go, Tit, thresh a bit! said the wag.
Suddenly a distant shout aroused him.
He started and opened his eyes.
Where am I? Oh yes, in the skirmishing line...
pass and watchword—shaft, Olmütz.
It won’t be long now before I am off duty.
It seemed to him that it was getting lighter.
I expect it’s snow...
a spot—une tache, he thought.
it’s not a tache...
sister, black eyes...
He was succumbing to irresistible, youthful, childish drowsiness.
But what was I thinking? I mustn’t forget.
Oh yes! Natásha...
Whom? The hussars...
Ah, the hussars with mustaches.
Along the Tverskáya Street rode the hussar with mustaches...
I thought about him too, just opposite Gúryev’s house...
Oh, but Denísov’s a fine fellow.
But that’s all nonsense.
The chief thing is that the Emperor is here.
No, it was I who dared not.
What? What? What?...
Cut them down! What?...
said Rostóv, waking up.
Who can tell, your honor? replied the hussar reluctantly.
From the direction, it must be the enemy, repeated Rostóv.
Steady! he cried to his fidgeting horse.
Rostóv no longer wanted to sleep.
Vive l’Empereur! l’Empereur! he now heard distinctly.
The hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily.
One was on a white horse.
Hardly, said Bagratión.
Well, go and see, he said, after a pause.
Another musket missed fire but flashed in the pan.
Rostóv turned his horse and galloped back.
But no more shots came.
They might retreat and leave the pickets.
Wait till tomorrow morning, we’ll find out everything tomorrow.
Very good, very good, said Bagratión.
Thank you, officer.
Oh, very well, you may stay in attendance on me.
Count Ilyá Rostóv’s son? asked Dolgorúkov.
But Rostóv did not reply.
Soldiers! I will myself direct your battalions.
It was cold and dark.
They’d be firing if we had.
And now here we stand hungry.
What division are you? shouted an adjutant, riding up.
Fine orders! was being repeated on different sides.
The troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited.
It was nine o’clock in the morning.
His gleaming eyes were fixed intently on one spot.
His predictions were being justified.
But still he did not begin the engagement.
When he had reached the village of Pratzen he halted.
It was there Prince Andrew thought the fight would concentrate.
In front and behind moved infantry.
That morning Kutúzov seemed worn and irritable.
Kutúzov laughed bitterly.
According to the dispositions...
The dispositions! exclaimed Kutúzov bitterly.
Who told you that?...
Kindly do as you are ordered.
Tell it to stop and await my orders.
Hardly had Prince Andrew started than he stopped him.
And ask whether sharpshooters have been posted, he added.
Prince Andrew galloped off to execute the order.
Plenty of time, he repeated.
Evidently the person they were greeting was riding quickly.
These were the two Emperors followed by their suites.
His whole appearance and manner were suddenly transformed.
I am waiting, Your Majesty, answered Kutúzov, bending forward respectfully.
Waiting, Your Majesty, repeated Kutúzov.
The silence lasted for about a minute.
God be with you, general! said the Emperor.
Glad to do our best! shouted the soldiers.
The Emperor’s horse started at the sudden cry.
Down below, on the left, the firing became more distinct.
Kutúzov had stopped and was speaking to an Austrian general.
It’s the enemy?...
Yes, see it is!...
But how is that? said different voices.
Here it is! The decisive moment has arrived.
The Ápsherons must be stopped, your excellency, cried he.
Blood was flowing from his cheek.
Prince Andrew forced his way to him.
Of Kutúzov’s suite only four remained.
They were all pale and exchanged looks in silence.
The soldiers started firing without orders.
Oh! Oh! Oh! groaned Kutúzov despairingly and looked around....
Several soldiers fell.
And really he only ran a few steps alone.
But Prince Andrew did not see how it ended.
But he saw nothing.
There is nothing, nothing, but that.
He sent him.
The firing grew louder and louder.
He was riding almost along the front line.
A handful of men came galloping toward him.
That is no business of mine, he thought.
Rostóv! What? he answered, not recognizing Borís.
Have you? he said.
Rostóv without hearing Borís to the end spurred his horse.
Where are you off to? asked Borís.
With a message to His Majesty.
I held my sword in my left hand, Count.
What can it be? he thought.
Kill the Germans! shouted one.
My God! What does it all mean? thought he.
But no, these must be only a handful of scoundrels.
It can’t be! said Rostóv.
It must have been someone else.
I saw him just as I see you....
There he sat in the carriage as pale as anything.
Not killed—wounded! another officer corrected him.
Who? Kutúzov? asked Rostóv.
Not Kutúzov, but what’s his name—well, never mind...
there are not many left alive.
The Emperor was wounded, the battle lost.
It was impossible to doubt it now.
Where is he to go? That way is nearer.
It’s all the same now.
He remembered his mother’s last letter.
He was happy to be seeing him.
What have I done? thought he.
Only some carts and carriages were passing by.
Rostóv followed them.
Tit! I say, Tit! said the groom.
What? answered the old man absent-mindedly.
Przebyszéwski and his corps had laid down their arms.
It was growing dusk.
Nobody gave him a look or thought of raising him.
The horses moved off the bank.
Toward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still.
He did not know how long his unconsciousness lasted.
And I did not know this suffering either, he thought.
He opened his eyes.
It was Napoleon accompanied by two aides-de-camp.
He heard the speaker addressed as Sire.
Ah! He is alive, said Napoleon.
Bonaparte, having come up at a gallop, stopped his horse.
Which is the senior? he asked, on seeing the prisoners.
They named the colonel, Prince Repnín.
I commanded a squadron, replied Repnín.
Your regiment fulfilled its duty honorably, said Napoleon.
I bestow it with pleasure, said Napoleon.
After looking at him Napoleon smiled.
He’s very young to come to meddle with us.
A splendid reply! said Napoleon.
Well, and you, young man, said he.
His face shone with self-satisfaction and pleasure.
The stretchers moved on.
Denísov gave no answer.
Why, that one, right at the end, the big one.
Don’t you see? That’s our house, said Rostóv.
Now then, get on, he shouted to the driver.
There was no one in the hall.
A solitary tallow candle burned in the anteroom.
Old Michael was asleep on the chest.
All well? asked Rostóv, drawing away his arm.
Yes, God be thanked! Yes! They’ve just finished supper.
Let me have a look at you, your excellency.
Everyone shouted, talked, and kissed him at the same time.
Only his mother was not there, he noticed that.
And I did not know...
Here he is...
Kólya, * dear fellow...
How he has changed!...
Where are the candles?...
And me, kiss me! Dearest...
The old countess had not yet come.
When they met, she fell on his breast, sobbing.
Nicholas wrote us...
This escapade made everybody feel confused.
There was a masculine odor and a smell of tobacco.
Hallo, Gwíska—my pipe! came Vasíli Denísov’s husky voice.
Is this your saber? he shouted.
The girls sprang aside.
The door, having let Pétya in, closed again.
A sound of laughter came from behind it.
Nicholas! Come out in your dressing gown! said Natásha’s voice.
Is this your saber? asked Pétya.
Oh, how nice, how splendid! she said to everything.
She touched his mustache.
I want to know what you men are like.
No, I’ll tell you now.
You know Sónya’s my dearest friend.
I burned this to prove my love for her.
Well, and is that all? he asked.
Natásha suddenly flushed.
Why, you remember before you went away?...
Well, she says you are to forget all that....
Rostóv became thoughtful.
I never go back on my word, he said.
We knew you’d say so.
Rostóv saw that it had been well considered by them.
Well then, that’s excellent, said he.
We’ll talk it over later on.
Oh, what nonsense! cried Natásha, laughing.
Have you seen Duport? No.
Not seen Duport—the famous dancer? Well then, you won’t understand.
That’s what I’m up to.
Only don’t tell anyone.
No, but don’t you think it’s nice? she kept repeating.
I don’t want to marry anyone.
But that’s all rubbish, Natásha chattered on.
And is Denísov nice? she asked.
Yes, indeed! Oh, well then, good-by: go and dress.
Is he very terrible, Denísov? Why terrible? asked Nicholas.
No, Váska is a splendid fellow.
Well then, be quick.
We’ll all have breakfast together.
When Rostóv met Sónya in the drawing room, he reddened.
He did not know how to behave with her.
The Rostóvs knew everybody in Moscow.
His passion for the Emperor had cooled somewhat in Moscow.
The count considered.
We can’t have less—yes, three...
the mayonnaise, that’s one, said he, bending down a finger.
Yes, it can’t be helped if they won’t take less.
Ah, dear me! I was forgetting.
We must have another entrée.
Ah, goodness gracious! he clutched at his head.
I must have two hundred pots here on Friday.
The old count pretended to be angry.
But I’ll go to Bezúkhov’s myself.
I have to see him in any case.
He has forwarded me a letter from Borís.
Thank God, Borís is now on the staff.
Tell Bezúkhov to come.
I’ll put his name down.
Is his wife with him? he asked.
Ah, my dear friend, he is very unfortunate, she said.
If what we hear is true, it is dreadful.
Anna Mikháylovna sighed deeply.
They say Pierre is quite broken by his misfortune.
It will be a tremendous banquet.
The soldiers, officers, and generals were heroes.
Nesvítski was there as an old member of the club.
The largest circles formed round Count Rostopchín, Valúev, and Narýshkin.
Please come and visit us...
you know my brave boy...
been together out there...
both playing the hero...
Ah, Vasíli Ignátovich...
George on his left breast.
But all eyes demanded that he should submit.
Facing them sat Pierre, beside Prince Nesvítski.
His efforts had not been in vain.
Everything was excellent.
All were silent, waiting for what he would say.
The band immediately struck up Conquest’s joyful thunder waken...
He nearly wept.
CHAPTER IV Pierre sat opposite Dólokhov and Nicholas Rostóv.
As usual, he ate and drank much, and eagerly.
His face was depressed and gloomy.
I have no right to, and can’t, believe it.
Why, I didn’t recognize you! he said.
Confound him, he’s a fool! said Rostóv.
He reddened and turned away.
He leaned his whole massive body across the table.
How dare you take it? he shouted.
Don’t! Don’t! What are you about? whispered their frightened voices.
Pale, with quivering lips, Pierre snatched the copy.
He hated her and was forever sundered from her.
And do you feel quite calm? Rostóv asked.
À demain, mon cher.
* * Till tomorrow, my dear fellow.
His haggard face was yellow.
He had evidently not slept that night.
Oh yes, it is horribly stupid, said Pierre.
There was no insult on either side.
Allow me to convey....
No! What is there to talk about? said Pierre.
It’s all the same....
Is everything ready? he added.
CHAPTER V Well, begin! said Dólokhov.
All right, said Pierre, still smiling in the same way.
A feeling of dread was in the air.
O-ne! T-wo! Thwee! he shouted angrily and stepped aside.
His mouth wore its usual semblance of a smile.
His face was pale.
Rostóv ran toward him and said something.
No-o-o! muttered Dólokhov through his teeth, no, it’s not over.
His frowning face was pallid and quivered.
began Dólokhov, but could not at first pronounce the word.
Please, he uttered with an effort.
Only ten paces divided them.
He raised his pistol and aimed.
Sideways! Cover yourself with your pistol! ejaculated Nesvítski.
Cover yourself! even Denísov cried to his adversary.
Denísov, Rostóv, and Nesvítski closed their eyes.
he repeated, puckering his face.
Nesvítski stopped him and took him home.
Rostóv and Denísov drove away with the wounded Dólokhov.
Well? How do you feel? he asked.
Where are we? In Moscow, I know.
I don’t matter, but I have killed her, killed...
She won’t get over it! She won’t survive....
Who? asked Rostóv.
He implored Rostóv to go on and prepare her.
What has happened? he asked himself.
I have killed her lover, yes, killed my wife’s lover.
But in what was I to blame? he asked.
And so it turns out.
He remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection.
I’m not such a fool....
Just you try it on....
Allez-vous promener, * she used to say.
* You clear out of this.
He digested his sufferings alone.
* I love you.
Then Robespierre was beheaded for being a despot.
I? What have I...? stammered Pierre.
If you won’t answer, I’ll tell you...
Hélène went on.
You believe everything you’re told.
You were told...
Don’t speak to me...
I beg you, muttered Pierre hoarsely.
We had better separate, he muttered in a broken voice.
Hélène’s face became terrible, she shrieked and sprang aside.
His father’s nature showed itself in Pierre.
He felt the fascination and delight of frenzy.
Her eyes grew dim.
Killed! The princess did not fall down or faint.
Go, Princess Mary.
Go and tell Lise.
I will follow.
at something joyful and mysterious taking place within her.
There, there! Do you feel it? I feel so strange.
Princess Mary could not lift her head, she was weeping.
What is the matter, Mary? Nothing...
only I feel sad...
Has anything come from Andrew? she asked.
No, you know it’s too soon for news.
But my father is anxious and I feel afraid.
Princess Mary hoped.
* Frühstück: breakfast.
Courage, my angel.
She kissed Lise and was about to leave the room.
No, it’s only indigestion?...
Say it’s only indigestion, say so, Mary! Say...
You young ladies should not know anything about it.
We’ll manage very well without a doctor.
She looked out.
On their faces was a quiet and solemn look.
Oh, nurse, I’m so glad! God is merciful, birdie.
Princess Mary took a book and began reading.
There was no laughter in the maids’ large hall.
Tíkhon went and told the prince.
The most solemn mystery in the world continued its course.
No one slept.
God is merciful, doctors are never needed, she said.
Most likely the doctor.
Oh, my God! thank God! said Princess Mary.
She went out on the stairs.
Thank God! said the voice.
It’s Andrew! thought Princess Mary.
He came up the stairs and embraced his sister.
Prince Andrew went round the sofa and kissed her forehead.
God is merciful....
She looked at him inquiringly and with childlike reproach.
The doctor entered.
They waited and listened.
Go, dear, said Princess Mary.
Piteous, helpless, animal moans came through the door.
Someone was holding it shut.
He began pacing the room.
The screaming ceased, and a few more seconds went by.
The door opened.
He went into his wife’s room.
The old man already knew everything.
He could not weep.
Few people do understand him.
I know people consider me a bad man! he said.
And most of them are harmful, especially the women.
and he made a gesture of contempt.
But you don’t understand it.
In the autumn the Rostóvs returned to Moscow.
Nicholas brought many young men to his parents’ house.
She almost quarreled with her brother about him.
I don’t know how to put it...
I’m certain of it; you’ll see.
Natásha’s prediction proved true.
He came because of Sónya.
About twenty people were present, including Dólokhov and Denísov.
Nicholas, will you come to Iogel’s? Please do! said Natásha.
He asked you, and Vasíli Dmítrich * is also going.
I’m even weady to dance the pas de châle.
If I have time, answered Nicholas.
But I promised the Arkhárovs; they have a party.
He called Natásha and asked her what was the matter.
Yes, my Sónya could not have done otherwise! thought Nicholas.
And Mamma pressed her! said Nicholas reproachfully.
Yes, said Natásha.
Now you don’t know that at all! said Nicholas.
But I must talk to her.
What a darling Sónya is! he added with a smile.
And Natásha kissed her brother and ran away.
Nicholas went up to her and kissed her hand.
he is my friend...
Sónya interrupted him.
I have already refused, she said hurriedly.
Sónya again interrupted.
She gave him an imploring, frightened look.
Nicholas, don’t tell me that! she said.
No, but I must.
That is enough for me, said Sónya, blushing.
Then I am young.
Mamma does not wish it.
In a word, I make no promise.
Don’t say that to me! I want nothing.
And Nicholas again kissed her hand.
CHAPTER XII Iogel’s were the most enjoyable balls in Moscow.
That year two marriages had come of these balls.
They were both particularly happy and gay.
They were both dressed in white muslin with pink ribbons.
Who? Countess Natásha, answered Denísov.
No, my dear fellow, I’ll be a wallflower, said Denísov.
Nicholas could not refuse Iogel and asked Sónya to dance.
He is a real dancer, a wonder! he said.
She saw that everybody was looking at her and waiting.
Nicholas saw that Denísov was refusing though he smiled delightedly.
He ran up to them.
Now then, Váska, said Nicholas.
I’ll sing for you a whole evening, said Natásha.
What does this mean? she brought out.
It’s a long time since we met, he said.
Thanks for coming.
Dólokhov made no reply.
You may punt, he said.
Rostóv felt ill at ease.
To try his luck or the certainty? Rostóv asked himself.
Dólokhov kept glancing at him.
Why don’t you play? he asked.
I have no money with me, he said.
I’ll trust you.
Dólokhov killed, that is, beat, ten cards of Rostóv’s running.
Gentlemen, said Dólokhov after he had dealt for some time.
The game continued; a waiter kept handing round champagne.
I lose to the others but win from you.
Or are you afraid of me? he asked again.
He well remembered that seven afterwards.
Come now, deal! exclaimed Rostóv.
Aah! Rostóv almost screamed lifting both hands to his head.
He had lost more than he could pay.
The whole interest was concentrated on Rostóv.
In reality it already exceeded twenty thousand rubles.
Six hundred rubles, ace, a corner, a nine...
winning it back’s impossible...
Oh, how pleasant it was at home!...
The knave, double or quits...
it can’t be!...
And why is he doing this to me? Rostóv pondered.
He knows of course what this loss means to me.
He can’t want my ruin.
What’s he to do if he has such luck?...
It’s all up! I’m lost! thought he.
It’s all the same to me, he said.
Dólokhov began to deal seriously.
The ten fell to him.
One does get tired sitting so long, he added.
Yes, I’m tired too, said Rostóv.
I cannot pay it all immediately.
Will you take an I.O.U.? he said.
Dólokhov started to say, but Nicholas interrupted him.
At home, they had not yet gone to bed.
Véra was playing chess with Shinshín in the drawing room.
Splendid! Excellent! exclaimed Natásha.
Another verse, she said, without noticing Nicholas.
Ah, and here’s Nicholas! cried Natásha, running up to him.
Is Papa at home? he asked.
All wight! All wight! shouted Denísov.
What is the matter? she asked.
Will Papa be back soon? I expect so.
Everything’s the same with them.
Natásha was preparing to sing.
Denísov was looking at her with enraptured eyes.
Nicholas began pacing up and down the room.
Sónya struck the first chord of the prelude.
She noticed at once that something had happened to him.
Nicholas turned away from her.
One, two, three...
one, two, three...
Oh mio crudele affetto....
One, two, three...
Oh, this senseless life of ours! thought Nicholas.
but this is real....
What were losses, and Dólokhov, and words of honor?...
Nicholas, hearing him drive up, went to meet him.
I was nearly forgetting.
I need some money.
I told you it would not be enough.
What! To whom?...
I promised to pay tomorrow, said Nicholas.
Natásha came running to her mother, quite excited.
He has made me...
The countess did not believe her ears.
Denísov had proposed.
Well then, tell him so.
Well, all the same, you must refuse him.
No, I mustn’t.
I am so sorry for him! He’s so nice.
Well then, accept his offer.
No, Mamma, but I’m so sorry for him.
I don’t know how I’m to say it.
And there’s nothing for you to say.
He jumped up at the sound of her light step.
It is in your hands.
Vasíli Dmítrich, I’m so sorry for you!...
No, but you are so nice...
but it won’t do...not that...
but as a friend, I shall always love you.
She kissed his rough curly black head.
She came up to them.
said Denísov, with downcast eyes and a guilty face.
He tried to say more, but faltered.
She began to sob aloud.
Next day Rostóv saw Denísov off.
He did not wish to stay another day in Moscow.
Sónya was more tender and devoted to him than ever.
Pierre was obliged to wait.
Is this good or bad? Pierre asked himself.
The answer was: You’ll die and all will end.
You’ll die and know all, or cease asking.
But dying was also dreadful.
All we can know is that we know nothing.
And that’s the height of human wisdom.
Everything within and around him seemed confused, senseless, and repellent.
He brought in a boiling samovar.
* To indicate he did not want more tea.
Give me the book, said the stranger.
Pierre looked at him.
Pierre looked silently and inquiringly at him over his spectacles.
You are unhappy, my dear sir, the stranger continued.
You are young and I am old.
Oh, yes! said Pierre, with a forced smile.
I am very grateful to you.
Your view of life is a regrettable delusion.
No one can attain to truth by himself.
I ought to tell you that I do not believe...
You cannot know Him.
Yes, yes, I am unhappy, assented Pierre.
He paused and sighed, evidently trying to calm himself.
He stopped and remained silent for a long time.
To know Him is hard....
The Mason smiled with his gentle fatherly smile.
Yes, yes, that is so, said Pierre joyfully.
The highest wisdom is one.
Yes, yes, assented Pierre.
Thou hatest it.
Look at your life, my dear sir.
You have become the possessor of wealth.
That is what you have done.
How about the horses? he asked, without looking at Pierre.
The exchange horses have just come, answered the servant.
Will you not rest here? No, tell them to harness.
I thank you.
I agree with all you have said.
But do not suppose me to be so bad.
Help me, teach me, and perhaps I may...
Pierre could not go on.
He gulped and turned away.
The Mason remained silent for a long time, evidently considering.
You are going to Petersburg.
Allow me to give you a piece of advice.
Yes, I do wish it, said he.
Willarski bowed his head.
yes, I believe in God, he said.
In that case...
began Willarski, but Pierre interrupted him.
Yes, I do believe in God, he repeated.
In that case we can go, said Willarski.
My carriage is at your service.
Willarski was silent throughout the drive.
From there they passed into another room.
A man in strange attire appeared at the door.
Having led him about ten paces, Willarski stopped.
Left alone, Pierre went on smiling in the same way.
He experienced a variety of most complex sensations.
Loud knocks were heard at the door.
It was a coffin with bones inside.
He was not at all surprised by what he saw.
Trying to stimulate his emotions he looked around.
The door opened and someone came in.
desire regeneration, Pierre uttered with difficulty.
Good! said the Rhetor quickly, apparently satisfied with this answer.
I have been an atheist, answered Pierre.
Yes, yes, assented Pierre.
Think this over and I will come to you again.
To combat the evil which sways the world...
These virtues were: 1.
Discretion, the keeping of the secrets of the Order.
Obedience to those of higher ranks in the Order.
Love of mankind.
The love of death.
I am ready for everything, said Pierre.
What you have with you: watch, money, rings....
My passion! I have had so many, replied Pierre.
Pierre paused, seeking a reply.
Women, he said in a low, scarcely audible voice.
The source of blessedness is not without us but within....
Now thou hast seen the lesser light, uttered a voice.
Some of them Pierre had met in Petersburg society.
Let into the wall was a star-shaped light.
Oh, hush, please! said another.
The Grand Master began reading the statutes.
Beware of making any distinctions which may infringe equality.
Be kindly and courteous.
Kindle in all hearts the flame of virtue.
The Grand Master rapped with his mallet.
Pierre was about to reply, but Prince Vasíli interrupted him.
She is living in Moscow and you are here.
I expect you feel it so yourself.
Prince Vasíli gave Pierre a significant look.
You know she is very gracious to Hélène.
And Prince Vasíli had to go without receiving any explanation.
Prince Vasíli expressed his opinion more openly.
Prince Hippolyte Kurágin—charming young fellow; M.
Kronq,—chargé d’affaires from Copenhagen—a profound intellect, and simply, Mr.
He liked Petersburg and despised Moscow.
* * Europe will never be our sincere ally.
On Tuesday between eight and nine.
It will give me great pleasure.
Everyone turned toward him.
It is the sword of Frederick the Great which I...
Anna Pávlovna frowned.
Mortemart, Hippolyte’s friend, addressed him firmly.
Oh, it’s nothing.
I only wished to say...
Oh, that wicked Prince Hippolyte! she said.
There are precedents, I may mention Schwarzenberg.
It’s impossible, replied another.
in the evening.
You must come....
Everywhere one heard curses on Bonaparte, the enemy of mankind.
Little Nicholas had been unwell for four days.
The maid brought it.
My dear, really...
it’s better not to wake him...
he’s asleep, said the princess in a tone of entreaty.
Perhaps we’d really better not wake him, he said hesitating.
As you please...
I think so...
Prince Andrew went out.
Well? he asked.
Still the same.
Wait, for heaven’s sake.
Prince Andrew went up to the child and felt him.
He was burning hot.
Andrew, don’t! said Princess Mary.
But I wish it, he said.
The child screamed hoarsely.
He still had all the letters in his hand.
Opening them mechanically he began reading.
When mischief-makers don’t meddle even a German beats Buonaparte.
He is said to be fleeing in great disorder.
Yes, yes, he’s always poking fun at me....
I begin ab ovo.
All this is absolutely true.
On the 4th, the first courier arrives from Petersburg.
We search, but none are to be found.
Those that follow are naturally increasingly interesting and entertaining.
He does so.
Buxhöwden pursues us—we scuttle.
At last our enemy, Buxhöwden, catches us and attacks.
The soft forehead was moist.
She pressed it.
He has perspired, said Prince Andrew.
I was coming to tell you so.
Prince Andrew looked at his sister.
He discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward.
Round the house was a garden newly laid out.
Everything bore an impress of tidiness and good management.
Well, what is it? came a sharp, unpleasant voice.
A visitor, answered Antón.
He was struck by the change in him.
I hardly know myself again.
My plans? he said, as if astonished at the word.
Well, you see, I’m building.
I mean to settle here altogether next year....
No, I meant to ask...
Pierre began, but Prince Andrew interrupted him.
But why talk of me?...
I am going back to my sister today.
I will introduce you to her.
We will go after dinner.
Let us have dinner, and then we’ll set off.
At dinner, conversation turned on Pierre’s marriage.
But you know it is all over, and forever.
Forever? said Prince Andrew.
Why so? asked Prince Andrew.
No, to kill a man is bad—wrong.
Why is it wrong? urged Prince Andrew.
Bad! Bad! exclaimed Pierre.
We all know what is bad for ourselves.
He spoke in French.
The only good is the absence of those evils.
And love of one’s neighbor, and self-sacrifice? began Pierre.
Prince Andrew looked silently at Pierre with an ironic smile.
I experienced just the reverse.
And he looked at Pierre with a mocking, challenging expression.
He evidently wished to draw him on.
You are joking, replied Pierre, growing more and more excited.
The one and the other may serve as a pastime.
Well, you want an argument, he added, come on then.
You can’t help thinking.
Ah, yes, hospitals, medicine.
And he does not want that.
Oh, that is dreadful, dreadful! said Pierre.
I don’t understand how one can live with such ideas.
myself most of all.
Then I don’t eat, don’t wash...
and how is it with you?...
Life as it is leaves one no peace.
And now there’s this recruiting.
Then you are serving? I am.
He paused a little while.
Prince Andrew grew more and more animated.
He did not reply.
Think? What about? asked Prince Andrew with surprise.
About life, about man’s destiny.
It can’t be so.
Well, what do you think about it? Pierre asked.
It’s all very well....
But who are we? Men.
Pierre interrupted him.
Do you believe in a future life? he asked.
Why? It cannot be that there is no answer.
And I believe there is....
And I have looked in....
The Someone is—God.
Prince Andrew did not reply.
There was perfect stillness.
Pierre became silent.
Yes, if it only were so! said Prince Andrew.
Those are Mary’s ‘God’s folk,’ said Prince Andrew.
They have mistaken us for my father.
This is the one matter in which she disobeys him.
But what are ‘God’s folk’? asked Pierre.
Prince Andrew had no time to answer.
What are ‘God’s folk’? asked Pierre.
Come, and you’ll see for yourself.
Charmée de vous voir.
After exchanging the first greetings, they sat down.
* Delighted to see you.
I am very glad to see you.
Andrew! said Princess Mary, imploringly.
Andrew, au nom de Dieu! *(2) Princess Mary repeated.
* You must know that this is a woman.
* (2) For heaven’s sake.
Princess Mary’s embarrassment on her people’s account was quite unnecessary.
They were not in the least abashed.
I have, good sir, she answered garrulously.
I only came across Pelagéya in Yúkhnovo....
In Kolyázin, master, a wonderful blessing has been revealed.
What is it? Some new relics? asked Prince Andrew.
Andrew, do leave off, said Princess Mary.
Don’t tell him, Pelagéya.
why not, my dear, why shouldn’t I? I like him.
Let me ask her, said Pierre.
Did you see it yourselves? he inquired.
Oh, yes, master, I was found worthy.
They impose on the people, he repeated.
Lord Jesus Christ! exclaimed the pilgrim woman, crossing herself.
God will punish you, she said admonishingly, turning to Pierre.
How did the star get into the icon? Pierre asked.
Pelagéya suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands.
Lord forgive him! My dear, what does it mean?...
she asked, turning to Princess Mary.
Now, why need you do it? said Princess Mary.
Why did you come to me?...
Come, Pelagéya, I was joking, said Pierre.
Princesse, ma parole, je n’ai pas voulu l’offenser.
It was all my fault, and Andrew was only joking.
Pierre listened to her attentively and seriously.
You are very kind, she said to him.
Oh, I really did not mean to hurt her feelings.
Princess Mary looked at him silently and smiled affectionately.
I am very anxious about him.
And I am also very much afraid for him spiritually.
He keeps it all within him.
If you could persuade him to go abroad.
Others don’t notice it, but I see it.
Prince Andrew and Pierre also went out into the porch.
The old prince disputed it chaffingly, but without getting angry.
The marshal, a Count Rostóv, hasn’t sent half his contingent.
And there, look at this....
A fine fellow—your friend—I like him! He stirs me up.
We’ll have another dispute.
They were all fond of him already.
Here, in the regiment, all was clear and simple.
And the rest was no concern of his.
Plátov’s division was acting independently of the main army.
well, for that reason....
They were bivouacking.
In April, Rostóv was on orderly duty.
Then Denísov’s voice was heard shouting farther and farther away.
Denísov had not yet returned.
Rostóv joined them.
So they are! said the officers.
Rostóv went to meet them.
You will answer for it, Captain.
It is mutiny—seizing the transport of one’s own army.
Our men have had nothing to eat for two days.
And mine have had nothing for two weeks, said Denísov.
Be off! Go! he shouted at the officers.
If you are determined to rob, I’ll...
I’ve taken twansports from the infantwy by force! he said.
After all, can’t let our men starve.
Denísov could not speak and gasped for breath.
Twy me for wobbewy...
oh! Some more water...
Let them twy me, but I’ll always thwash scoundwels...
and I’ll tell the Empewo’...
I get there, began Denísov.
‘Now then, where’s your chief’s quarters?’ They were pointed out.
I enter, and at the table...
who do you think? No, but wait a bit!...
‘Ah, what a...
what a...!’ and I sta’ted fwashing him...
You’ve set your arm bleeding afresh.
Wait, we must tie it up again.
Denísov was bandaged up again and put to bed.
Next day he woke calm and cheerful.
The doctor was followed by a Russian assistant.
I can’t tear myself to pieces, the doctor was saying.
Come to Makár Alexéevich in the evening.
I shall be there.
The assistant asked some further questions.
What do you want, sir? said the doctor.
How so? asked Rostóv.
It’s death to go in.
Some five of us doctors have died in this place....
I don’t know.
I can’t tell you, sir.
Four hundred, sir, and they’re always sending me fresh ones.
The assistant looked fagged out.
Major Denísov, Rostóv said again.
He was wounded at Molliten.
Dead, I fancy.
Eh, Makéev? queried the doctor, in a tone of indifference.
The assistant, however, did not confirm the doctor’s words.
Is he tall and with reddish hair? asked the doctor.
Rostóv described Denísov’s appearance.
That one is dead, I fancy.
However, I’ll look up our list.
We had a list.
Only don’t blame me! the doctor shouted up after him.
Rostóv and the assistant went into the dark corridor.
He stood still, looking silently around.
He had not at all expected such a sight.
Rostóv listened and made out the word.
Who looks after the sick here? he asked the assistant.
Why, this one seems...
he began, turning to the assistant.
He’s been dead since morning.
After all we’re men, not dogs.
I’ll send someone at once.
Let us go, your honor.
Some were walking about the rooms in hospital dressing gowns.
See where we’ve met again! said the little man.
In the middle of the reading, the Uhlan interrupted Denísov.
Let them twy me, I’m not afwaid of anyone.
Listen, I’m w’iting to them stwaight.
One has to submit, and Vasíli Dmítrich doesn’t want to.
Well, let it be bad, said Denísov.
No doubt he (indicating Rostóv) has connections on the staff.
You won’t find a better opportunity.
He knew his stubborn will and straightforward hasty temper.
Denísov was moodily silent all the evening.
Hand it in.
He did not finish, but gave a painfully unnatural smile.
You are speaking of Buonaparte? asked the general, smiling.
I am speaking, Prince, of the Emperor Napoleon, he replied.
The general patted him on the shoulder, with a smile.
The interview had lasted an hour and fifty-three minutes.
Borís lodged with another adjutant, the Polish Count Zhilínski.
But Rostóv had noticed his first impulse.
I’ve come at a bad time I think.
* In a minute I shall be at your disposal.
I see I’m intruding, Rostóv repeated.
So it seemed to Rostóv.
Count Zhilínski—le Comte N.
N.—le Capitaine S.
S., said he, naming his guests.
No, I came on business, replied Rostóv, briefly.
Come and talk over my business and I’ll go away.
Oh, no, not at all, said Borís.
They went into the little room where Borís slept.
But in general, I think...
On the contrary, I will do what I can.
Only I thought...
At that moment Zhilínski’s voice was heard calling Borís.
Well then, go, go, go...
The Emperors were to be present at that banquet.
That’s settled, thought Nicholas.
I may see him at any moment, thought Rostóv.
He understands everything, knows everything.
After all, people do go in....
I will fall at his feet and beseech him.
Whom do you want? someone inquired.
This man was speaking to someone in the adjoining room.
Another petitioner, answered the man with the braces.
Tell him to come later.
He’ll be coming out directly, we must go.
It’s too late...
Are you an officer? Lieutenant Count Rostóv.
What audacity! Hand it in through your commander.
And go along with you...
I’m sorry, sorry for that fine fellow.
Give me the letter.
It could be no one else.
Andrew ribbon over his shoulder.
Napoleon’s face wore an unpleasant and artificial smile.
Alexander was saying something affable to him.
An aide-de-camp behind him rushed forward and picked it up.
To whomever Your Majesty commands.
Can it be me? thought Rostóv.
And it really did.
The Emperors remounted and rode away.
Lázarev sat in the place of honor.
Have you seen Lázarev? I have.
Tomorrow, I hear, the Preobrazhénskis will give them a dinner.
Tomorrow our Emperor will send a St.
George’s Cross to the bravest of the French Guards.
It has to be done.
He must respond in kind.
Nothing, nothing, replied Rostóv.
You’ll call round? Yes, I will.
Terrible doubts rose in his soul.
He went to a hotel he had noticed that morning.
Two officers of his own division joined him.
The conversation naturally turned on the peace.
Nicholas ate and drank (chiefly the latter) in silence.
He finished a couple of bottles of wine by himself.
But Rostóv did not listen to him.
If we are ordered to die, we must die.
Yes, and to drink, assented Nicholas.
Hullo there! Another bottle! he shouted.
Yes, really everything is green already....
But the oaks show no sign yet.
Spring, love, happiness! this oak seemed to say.
It was now hot spring weather.
The whole forest was already clothed in green.
Suddenly, he did not know why, he felt a pang.
He opened the casement.
The night was fresh, bright, and very still.
His room was on the first floor.
Those in the rooms above were also awake.
He heard female voices overhead.
But when are you coming to bed? replied another voice.
Sónya! Sónya! he again heard the first speaker.
Do just come and see what a moon!...
Oh, how lovely! Come here....
Take care, you’ll fall out.
Oh, you only spoil things for me.
The whole day had been hot.
all this rushed suddenly to his mind.
Now reason suggested quite the opposite.
CHAPTER IV Prince Andrew arrived in Petersburg in August, 1809.
Count Arakchéev’s anteroom had quite a special character.
Some walked thoughtfully up and down, others whispered and laughed.
This officer’s audience lasted a long time.
Arakchéev turned his head toward him without looking at him.
What is your petition? asked Arakchéev.
I am not petitioning, your excellency, returned Prince Andrew quietly.
Arakchéev’s eyes turned toward him.
Sit down, said he.
Prince Bolkónski? I am not petitioning about anything.
Nowadays everybody designs laws, it is easier writing than doing.
Here! and he handed it to Prince Andrew.
Prince Andrew smiled.
I don’t want one.
A member without salary, repeated Arakchéev.
I have the honor...
He manages everything.
I’ll speak to him.
He has promised to come this evening.
Afraid of being late...
said the old man, looking at Kochubéy.
There’s one thing I don’t understand, he continued.
Count Kochubéy did not finish.
It was Speránski.
I am very glad to make your acquaintance.
Speránski smiled more markedly.
He paused at the full stop.
This flattered Prince Andrew.
I began the service from the lower grade.
Grounds of personal ambition maybe, Speránski put in quietly.
And of state interest to some extent, said Prince Andrew.
What do you mean? asked Speránski quietly, lowering his eyes.
Probably Prince Andrew’s thought interested him.
His arguments were concise, simple, and clear.
Every courtier considers himself bound to maintain his position worthily.
or: They cannot understand this...
When he put his foot down it sank in.
He divided the Brothers he knew into four categories.
His heart was not in the mystical aspect of Freemasonry.
Pierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing.
In the summer of 1809 Pierre returned to Petersburg.
The meeting was a full one.
After the usual ceremonies Pierre rose and began his address.
Pierre raised his notebook and began to read.
No! We are very far from that.
This aim was that of Christianity itself.
Our order should provide means to that end.
* The Illuminati sought to substitute republican for monarchical institutions.
Nothing mattered to him.
Petersburg, 23rd November I am again living with my wife.
It gave me joy to tell her this.
At Erfurt her success had been brilliant.
*(2) The distinguished Prince de Ligne wrote her eight-page letters.
* That’s a superb animal.
This shade of deference also disturbed Pierre.
27th November I got up late.
On waking I lay long in bed yielding to sloth.
Brother Urúsov came and we talked about worldly vanities.
He told me of the Emperor’s new projects.
My tongue is my enemy.
They laid on me the duty of Rhetor.
I feel myself weak and unworthy.
was very eloquent.
In the evening the admission took place.
It was Borís Drubetskóy who was admitted.
I nominated him and was the Rhetor.
Though I am unworthy, much was revealed to me.
Adonai is the name of the creator of the world.
Elohim is the name of the ruler of all.
Talks with Brother V.
strengthen, refresh, and support me in the path of virtue.
In his presence doubt has no place.
The Trinity—the three elements of matter—are sulphur, mercury, and salt.
Mercury is a fluid, volatile, spiritual essence.
Christ, the Holy Spirit, Him!...
3rd December Awoke late, read the Scriptures but was apathetic.
Afterwards went and paced up and down the large hall.
At the time I gave him no answer.
Afterwards Borís Drubetskóy came and began relating various adventures.
My God, I cannot get on with him at all.
The cause of this is my egotism.
I began to throttle it with my hands.
And suddenly Brother A.
I looked round and saw Brother A.
I woke up.
We were sitting or lying on the floor.
Joseph Alexéevich’s face had looked young and bright.
In the Finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself.
* That girl shall be my wife.
So they gave their consent.
Berg blushed and smiled.
She is so...
But my fiancée!...
The old count felt this most.
Nor had he any money.
I like your being businesslike about it....
I like it.
You shall be satisfied....
Yes, yes, all right! said the count hurriedly.
Yes, yes! Kiss me.
Since then she had not seen him.
When the Rostóvs came to Petersburg Borís called on them.
He drove to their house in some agitation.
The memory of Natásha was his most poetic recollection.
This expression on his face pleased Natásha.
And is Papa older? she asked.
This Natásha noticed at once.
This gaze disturbed and confused Borís more and more.
From day to day he became more and more entangled.
The countess—her prayerful mood dispelled—looked round and frowned.
Now then, now then! said she.
Mamma, can we have a talk? Yes? said Natásha.
Now, just one on your throat and another...
What is it tonight?—But I have to tell you...
Natásha put her hand on her mother’s mouth.
Don’t say it—I know.
No, do tell me! and she removed her hand.
Tell me, Mamma! He’s nice? Natásha, you are sixteen.
At your age I was married.
You say Borís is nice.
But what then?...
Natásha was listening and considering.
Well, what then? said she.
Why not? said Natásha, without changing her position.
and because you yourself don’t love him.
How do you know? I know.
It is not right, darling! But if I want to...
Leave off talking nonsense, said the countess.
But if I want to...
Natásha, I am in earnest...
Natásha did not let her finish.
Crazy? repeated Natásha.
I’ll tell you some things about myself.
I had a cousin...
I know! Cyril Matvéich...
but he is old.
He was not always old.
He need not come so often....
Natásha smiled and looked at her mother.
Not to marry, but just so, she added.
How so, my pet? Just so.
There’s no need for me to marry him.
Don’t laugh, stop! cried Natásha.
Don’t you understand? Narrow, you know—gray, light gray...
What rubbish you’re talking! said the countess.
Natásha continued: Don’t you really understand? Nicholas would understand....
You flirt with him too, said the countess, laughing.
No, he is a Freemason, I have found out.
He is fine, dark-blue and red....
It was a long time before she could sleep.
No, how could she? She’s virtuous.
Even Mamma does not understand.
It is wonderful how clever I am and how...
There is everything, everything in her, continued this man.
She is unusually intelligent, charming...
No, a minister...
Don’t you see the plumes?...
was whispered among the crowd.
Natásha was going to her first grand ball.
Sónya and her mother put themselves entirely in her hands.
That bow is not right.
Oh, dear! Well then, wait.
That’s right, Sónya.
Don’t do it without me! called Natásha.
You won’t do it right.
But it’s already ten.
Mávra, quicker, darling! Give me my thimble, Miss, from there...
Here is some scent.
Perónskaya must be tired of waiting.
Natásha began putting on the dress.
Sónya slammed the door to.
A minute later they let the count in.
The dress was too long.
Well, if it’s too long we’ll tack it up...
Mamma, your cap, more to this side, said Natásha.
But they had still to call at the Taurida Gardens.
Perónskaya was quite ready.
She praised the Rostóvs’ toilets.
And this was the very attitude that became her best.
All was blended into one brilliant procession.
* Delighted to see you.
Charming! said he, kissing the tips of his fingers.
There are some like ourselves and some worse, she thought.
How lovely! She is quite equal to Márya Antónovna.
Beautiful and clever...
they say Prince —— is quite mad about her.
She is a splendid match, a millionairess, said Perónskaya.
And look, here come her suitors.
But your cousin, Drubetskóy, is also very attentive to her.
They say she has millions.
No one more charming in society.
He pushed through, evidently looking for someone.
You remember, he stayed a night with us at Otrádnoe.
Oh, you know him? said Perónskaya.
I can’t bear him.
Il fait à présent la pluie et le beau temps.
* He’s too proud for anything.
Takes after his father.
* He is all the rage just now.
Behind him walked his host and hostess.
She wanted to cry.
Perónskaya had left them.
The count was at the other end of the room.
Borís passed them twice and each time turned away.
The Emperor looked smilingly down the room.
A minute passed but no one had yet begun dancing.
You always dance.
I have a protégée, the young Rostóva, here.
Ask her, he said.
Where is she? asked Bolkónski.
He stepped forward in the direction Pierre indicated.
The despairing, dejected expression of Natásha’s face caught his eye.
He asked her to waltz.
They were the second couple to enter the circle.
She noticed and saw nothing of what occupied everyone else.
She did go first to her cousin.
He was gloomy and absent-minded.
On her way to supper Natásha passed him.
Pierre’s gloomy, unhappy look struck her.
She stopped in front of him.
How delightful it is, Count! said she.
Yes, I am very glad, he said.
How can people be dissatisfied with anything? thought Natásha.
Yes, it was a very brilliant ball, and then...
Yes, that little Rostóva is very charming.
There’s something fresh, original, un-Petersburg-like about her that distinguishes her.
The Emperor’s speech had been extraordinary.
The other guests were Gervais, Magnítski, and Stolýpin.
Someone—it sounded like Speránski—was distinctly ejaculating ha-ha-ha.
He entered the dining room.
His guests surrounded him.
Very pleased to see you, Prince, he said.
he went on, turning to Magnítski and interrupting his story.
Magnítski starting quizzing Stolýpin about his vehemence.
But their gaiety seemed to Prince Andrew mirthless and tiresome.
They all seemed very gay.
After dinner Speránski’s daughter and her governess rose.
And that gesture, too, seemed unnatural to Prince Andrew.
The men remained at table over their port—English fashion.
For a few moments all were silent.
He was interrupted several times by applause.
Where are you off to so early? asked Speránski.
I promised to go to a reception.
They said no more.
Natásha was one of the first to meet him.
He felt happy and at the same time sad.
What about? His former love? The little princess? His disillusionments?...
His hopes for the future?...
Yes and no.
Prince Andrew left the Rostóvs’ late in the evening.
I have just been to see the countess, your wife.
We shall make up a rubber.
Our general is coming.
He is very good to me.
We shall have supper, Count.
So you will do me the favor.
See how I managed from my first promotion.
* To be a man.
Yes, answered Véra, I don’t at all want that.
We must live for society.
Just then Count Bezúkhov was announced.
This is what comes of knowing how to conduct oneself.
Berg smiled again.
Before long Borís, Berg’s old comrade, arrived.
Everything was just as it was everywhere else.
What’s the matter with her? thought Pierre, glancing at her.
Yes, that is true, Prince.
And it must be confessed that Natalie is very susceptible.
Prince Andrew frowned and remained silent.
You are friendly with Borís, aren’t you? asked Véra.
Yes, I know him....
Yes, you know between cousins intimacy often leads to love.
Le cousinage est un dangereux voisinage.
I must have a talk with you, said Prince Andrew.
Berg was satisfied and happy.
The smile of pleasure never left his face.
Prince Andrew surprised her by his timidity.
But such a...
never happened to me before! she said.
Only I feel afraid in his presence.
I am always afraid when I’m with him.
Now go! All the same I shan’t sleep.
And could we ever have thought!...
It is fate.
‘Marriages are made in heaven,’ said her mother.
That day Countess Hélène had a reception at her house.
It was Prince Andrew.
Ah, it’s you! said Pierre with a preoccupied, dissatisfied air.
And I, you see, am hard at it.
I never experienced anything like it before.
With Natásha Rostóva, yes? said he.
I am too old for her....
I always thought it....
That girl is such a treasure...
she is a rare girl....
But what of her? She loves you.
Don’t talk rubbish...
said Prince Andrew, smiling and looking into Pierre’s eyes.
She does, I know, Pierre cried fiercely.
Well, go on, go on.
Darkness and gloom, reiterated Pierre: yes, yes, I understand that.
Mind, the last...
On the second and third day it was the same.
Three weeks passed in this way.
She blushed continually and was irritable.
Passing a mirror she glanced into it.
Well, and very nice too! I need nobody.
She listened to the sounds in the hall.
When she saw herself, her face was pale.
It was he.
Pale and agitated, Natásha ran into the drawing room.
Mamma! Bolkónski has come! she said.
Mamma, it is awful, it is unbearable! I don’t want...
to be tormented? What am I to do?...
As soon as he saw Natásha his face brightened.
It is long since we had the pleasure...
The countess lowered her eyes, sighing deeply.
I am at your disposal, she murmured.
At once? This instant!...
No, it can’t be! she thought.
The countess’ face flushed hotly, but she said nothing.
she began at last sedately.
He remained silent, looking into her eyes.
I am glad.
And my husband...
but it will depend on her....
I will speak to her when I have your consent....
Do you give it to me? said Prince Andrew.
Yes, replied the countess.
It is unavoidable, said Prince Andrew with a sigh.
Sónya said that Natásha was in her bedroom.
Seeing her mother she jumped up and flew to her.
Go, go to him.
Natásha never remembered how she entered the drawing room.
When she came in and saw him she paused.
Prince Andrew came up to her with downcast eyes.
He took her hand and kissed it.
Forgive me! he said.
said Prince Andrew with an unnatural smile.
Why do you say that? Natásha interrupted him.
In a year you will learn to know yourself....
But why a year? Why a year?...
Natásha did not hear him.
And can’t it be helped? she asked.
I am so happy.
Often when all sitting together everyone kept silent.
They rarely spoke of their future life.
Prince Andrew was afraid and ashamed to speak of it.
Once she began questioning him about his son.
Why not? asked Natásha in a frightened tone.
I cannot take him away from his grandfather, and besides...
Pierre seemed disconcerted and embarrassed.
He did so.
You have known Bezúkhov a long time? he asked.
He has a heart of gold.
You may cease to...
all right, I know I am not to say that.
You ask whether we shall spend next winter in Moscow.
And my father cannot stand this.
In any case it will be decided very shortly.
He has become thinner and more nervous.
I hope it will cure him.
On his arrival in Petersburg he received only his due.
Good-by, my dear friend.
May God keep you in His holy and mighty care.
My dear friend, Mademoiselle Bourienne, sends you kisses.
He informed her of his engagement to Natásha Rostóva.
You know me and my relations with Father.
I want nothing from him.
It won’t be long—I shall soon set him free.
A good family!...
She will be little Nicholas’ stepmother and I’ll marry Bourienne!...
Go in heaven’s name! Go out into the frost...
Why shouldn’t I marry her? he asked his daughter.
Princess Mary was particularly fond of her.
thought Princess Mary.
This letter grieved and mortified Nicholas.
This letter touched Nicholas.
A week later he obtained his leave.
Pétya and Natásha surprised Nicholas most.
You’re not the same at all, he said.
Yes, yes, yes! cried Natásha, joyfully.
Well, are you glad? Natásha asked.
I am so tranquil and happy now.
Very glad, answered Nicholas.
He is an excellent fellow....
I feel at peace and settled.
Not at all as before.
You don’t at all understand, she said.
Nicholas was silent and agreed with her.
Her brother often wondered as he looked at her.
Why this delay? Why no betrothal? he thought.
Don’t tell Natásha.
I’ll hack the dog to pieces! I’m not my father!...
and so on.
No, my dear boy (the count, too, felt embarrassed.
No, I beg you to attend to the business.
I am old.
Forgive me if I have caused you unpleasantness.
I understand it all less than you do.
This, answered Nicholas.
You say it rests with me.
All that day the hounds remained at home.
Nicholas went out into the wet and muddy porch.
There was a smell of decaying leaves and of dog.
This scorn was not offensive to his master.
Can you resist it? those eyes seemed to be asking.
Daniel did not answer, but winked instead.
He says she’s moved them into the Otrádnoe enclosure.
They were howling there.
Come to me with Uvárka.
As you please.
Then put off feeding them.
Pétya ran in at the same time.
You are going? asked Natásha.
You know it is my greatest pleasure, said Natásha.
‘No barrier bars a Russian’s path’—we’ll go! shouted Pétya.
But you can’t.
Mamma said you mustn’t, said Nicholas to Natásha.
Yes, I’ll go.
I shall certainly go, said Natásha decisively.
Each dog knew its master and its call.
I was sure of it, began Uncle.
They’ll take the cubs from under your very nose.
That’s where I’m going.
Shall we join up our packs? asked Nicholas.
Pétya, who was laughing, whipped and pulled at his horse.
Uncle looked round disapprovingly at Pétya and Natásha.
Good morning, Uncle! We are going too! shouted Pétya.
Natásha understood it.
We’ll go to our places and won’t budge.
Well, nephew, you’re going for a big wolf, said Uncle.
They all took up their places.
His horses and trap were sent home.
Two wise old dogs lay down unleashed.
He was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive.
Well, Nastásya Ivánovna! whispered the count, winking at him.
Hush! whispered the count and turned to Simon.
Have you seen the young countess? he asked.
Though she’s a lady, she’s very fond of hunting.
He knows where to stand.
To search far...
repeated the count, evidently sorry Simon had not said more.
They are on the scent of the cubs...
he whispered, straight to the Lyádov uplands.
The count started and dropped the snuffbox.
Nastásya Ivánovna dismounted to pick it up.
The count and Simon were looking at him.
You’ve let the wolf go!...
But Simon was no longer there.
He expected the wolf to come his way any moment.
Hope alternated with despair.
Rostóv, holding his breath, looked round at the borzois.
Ulyulyulyu! whispered Rostóv, pouting his lips.
Back or forward? Eh, no matter, forward...
Nearer and nearer...
Ulyulyulyulyu! shouted Nicholas.
There was still hope.
Karáy? Old fellow!...
Oh my God! Why? Nicholas cried in despair.
She was again hemmed in.
Old Count Rostóv also rode up and touched the wolf.
Oh, what a formidable one! said he.
Yes, your excellency, answered Daniel, quickly doffing his cap.
The borzois bore down on it....
What’s this? thought Nicholas.
Where’s that huntsman from? He is not ‘Uncle’s’ man.
What has happened? asked Nicholas.
Nicholas agreed, and the hunt, now doubled, moved on.
The way to Iligin’s upland was across the fields.
The hunt servants fell into line.
The masters rode together.
That black-spotted one of yours is fine—well shaped! said he.
Yes, we must ride up....
And you, Michael Nikanórovich? he said, addressing Uncle.
All were moving slowly and sedately.
Miláshka, dear! rose Nicholas’ triumphant cry.
The hare had squatted.
Erzá, darling! Ilágin wailed in a voice unlike his own.
Erzá did not hearken to his appeal.
A ring of borzois surrounded him.
He spoke without himself knowing whom to or what about.
That’s it, come on! That’s a dog!...
There are your thousand-ruble ones....
That’s it, come on!...
That’s it, come on! said Uncle.
Uncle’s offer was accepted.
The serfs all dispersed.
The study smelt strongly of tobacco and dogs.
From behind this came women’s laughter and whispers.
Pétya, leaning on his elbow, fell asleep at once.
Natásha and Nicholas were silent.
Their faces glowed, they were hungry and very cheerful.
Here I am.
Anísya Fëdorovna left the room.
Death will come.
That’s it, come on! Nothing will remain.
I am not fit for it.
That’s for you—I haven’t brains enough.
That’s Mítka, my coachman....
I have got him a good balaláyka.
I’m fond of it, said Uncle.
Uncle was fond of such music.
Very good? said Natásha reproachfully, noticing her brother’s tone.
The air was repeated a hundred times.
That’s a good player of ours, she added.
Do you play then? asked Natásha.
Uncle did not answer, but smiled.
I haven’t touched it for a long time.
That’s it—come on! I’ve given it up.
She jumped up and hugged and kissed him.
* The French shawl dance.
That’s it—come on! He’s chosen already, said Nicholas smiling.
And such a one! she said.
But he would understand it all.
But this lasted only a second.
Natásha was in ecstasies over Uncle’s singing.
Natásha and Nicholas got into the other.
Yes, returned Nicholas.
You’re not cold? No.
I’m quite, quite all right.
They remained silent a long while.
The night was dark and damp.
Got it? said Nicholas.
What were you thinking about just now, Nicholas? inquired Natásha.
They were fond of asking one another that question.
I? said Nicholas, trying to remember.
What a good fellow Uncle is! Don’t you think so?...
Well, and you? I? Wait a bit, wait....
And then I thought...
No, nothing else.
She invited Nicholas to come to Moscow.
You have not understood me, Nikólenka.
She began to cry.
I would sacrifice anything for you—even my feelings.
Nicholas was spending the last of his leave at home.
Things were not cheerful in the Rostóvs’ home.
It was the dullest time of the day.
The old count was resting in his study.
The countess was playing patience.
What do you want? Him...
I want him...
Sit down with me a little, said the countess.
Mamma, I want him.
Stop playing—there’s a time for everything, said the old woman.
Let her alone, Kondrátevna, said Natásha.
Go, Mavrúshka, go.
They broke off and rose as she entered.
What can I do with them? thought Natásha.
Oh, Nikíta, please go...
where can I send him?...
Just a few oats? said Misha, cheerfully and readily.
Go, go quickly, the old man urged him.
And you, Theodore, get me a piece of chalk.
Natásha liked to test her power over him.
Why, fleas, crickets, grasshoppers, answered the buffoon.
Pétya! Pétya! she called to him.
Carry me downstairs.
Pétya ran up and offered her his back.
She was in a mood for brooding on the past.
Yes it was exactly the same, thought Natásha.
Sónya, what is this? she cried, twanging a thick string.
I don’t know.
A storm? she ventured timidly, afraid of being wrong.
Where were you going? she asked.
To change the water in this glass.
I am just finishing the design.
And where’s Nicholas? Asleep, I think.
Sónya, go and wake him, said Natásha.
Tell him I want him to come and sing.
But perhaps he’ll come today, will come immediately.
Perhaps he came yesterday and I have forgotten it.
Well, sit down by me.
and suddenly I felt so depressed...
And I was innocent—that was the chief thing, said Natásha.
Do you remember? I remember, answered Nicholas.
We were terribly absurd.
A Negro, chimed in Nicholas with a smile of delight.
Of course I remember.
Sónya, do you remember? asked Nicholas.
Yes, yes, I do remember something too, Sónya answered timidly.
It isn’t wanted, Pólya.
Tell them to take it away, replied Natásha.
They were now discussing dreams.
Why is it hard to imagine eternity? said Natásha.
Natásha! Now it’s your turn.
Sing me something, they heard the countess say.
Natásha stopped abruptly.
The young people had disappeared.
A Turkish girl was Pétya.
A clown was Dimmler.
No, why disturb the old fellow? said the countess.
Besides, you wouldn’t have room to turn round there.
If you must go, go to the Melyukóvs’.
I’ll dress up at once and go with them.
I’ll make Pashette open her eyes.
Sónya’s costume was the best of all.
Her mustache and eyebrows were extraordinarily becoming.
How light it is, Nicholas! came Sónya’s voice.
Nicholas looked back.
Nicholas overtook the first sleigh.
Where are we? thought he.
It’s the Kosóy meadow, I suppose.
But no—this is something new I’ve never seen before.
Well, whatever it may be...
Now, look out, master! he cried.
Nicholas began to draw ahead.
No you won’t, master! he shouted.
Again checking his horses, Nicholas looked around him.
And he looked round in the sleigh.
Aren’t you cold? he asked.
They did not answer but began to laugh.
Yes, yes! some voices answered, laughing.
Who is it? asked someone in the porch.
The mummers from the count’s.
I know by the horses, replied some voices.
The clown—Dimmler—and the lady—Nicholas—started a dance.
Dear me, there’s a Circassian.
Really, how becoming it is to dear Sónya.
Ha, ha, ha!...
I can’t look at him...
different voices were saying.
Ten minutes later, all the young Melyukóvs joined the mummers.
I suppose it is one of the Rostóvs! Well, Mr.
That’s not forbidden by his law.
My little Sásha! Look at Sásha! she said.
In an hour, all the costumes were crumpled and disordered.
Why? said the eldest Melyukóv girl.
You wouldn’t go, it takes courage....
I’ll go, said Sónya.
After sitting a while, she suddenly hears someone coming...
Ah! ah! screamed Natásha, rolling her eyes with horror.
Yes? And how...
did he speak? Yes, like a man.
Then he caught her up.
It was lucky the maids ran in just then....
Now, why frighten them? said Pelagéya Danílovna.
Mamma, you used to try your fate yourself...
said her daughter.
Well, say you went to the barn now, and listened.
Mamma, tell us what happened to you in the barn.
Pelagéya Danílovna smiled.
Oh, I’ve forgotten...
I’m not afraid of anything, said Sónya.
May I go at once? She got up.
What a darling that girl is! thought he.
The crowd of people really had made the house stuffy.
He knew Sónya would pass that way.
This path led to the barn.
Only, don’t look back.
Sónya came along, wrapped in her cloak.
She ran rapidly toward him.
was all they said.
Yes! she replied.
Now I am so glad! Well, run back to her.
No, wait a bit....
Natásha, it’s magical, isn’t it? Yes, she replied.
You have done splendidly.
Mamma said she was angling for you.
Only when will all that be? I am afraid never....
Sit down, Natásha; perhaps you’ll see him, said Sónya.
You mustn’t laugh, Miss, said Dunyásha.
You sit down now, Sónya.
You absolutely must, tonight! Do it for me....
Sónya heard this and Natásha’s whisper: I know she will.
She saw something last year.
For about three minutes all were silent.
Of course she will! whispered Natásha, but did not finish...
Oh, Natásha! she cried.
You saw him? urged Natásha, seizing her hand.
Wait a bit...
Yes, I saw him, she said.
How? Standing or lying? No, I saw...
Well, and then, Sónya?...
She was ready to sacrifice everything for her benefactors.
She was silent and sad and did not reply.
she almost screamed, so as to drown his voice.
Mamma darling, it’s not at all so...
Nicholas, I’ll explain to you.
Go away! Listen, Mamma darling, said Natásha.
His letters for the most part irritated her.
Natásha’s trousseau had to be ordered and the house sold.
And this life suddenly seemed to Pierre unexpectedly loathsome.
At balls he danced if a partner was needed.
* He is charming; he has no sex.
Yet he had to live and to find occupation.
He read, and read everything that came to hand.
I’ll get it unraveled.
The prince had aged very much that year.
She had quite abandoned the hope of getting married.
Princess Mary flushed and ran out of the room.
She did not finish.
Leave my room, she exclaimed, and burst into sobs.
He doesn’t obey...
I said it twice...
Métivier came to see the prince about twice a week.
On December 6—St.
Until the doctor’s arrival the morning had passed off safely.
* To force the guard.
and he slammed the door.
She was to blame that a spy had been admitted.
I am calm.
At two o’clock the six chosen guests assembled for dinner.
Oh, yes, yes! replied the commander in chief.
How is he?...
All were silent or talked in low tones.
Prince Nicholas came in serious and taciturn.
Princess Mary seemed even quieter and more diffident than usual.
Nowadays they are always writing! and he laughed unnaturally.
All were silent.
Impudent fellows! said the prince.
After the roast, champagne was served.
The guests rose to congratulate the old prince.
Princess Mary, too, went round to him.
We ought not to fight either for or against Austria.
He began speaking louder, evidently to be heard by everyone.
All were silent.
Good-by, my dear fellow....
Following Rostopchín’s example the others also rose.
Oh yes, she answered.
You noticed nothing? her look asked.
Pierre was in an agreeable after-dinner mood.
He looked straight before him and smiled quietly.
Have you known that young man long, Princess? he asked.
No, not long....
You have observed that? said Princess Mary.
I can read him like a book.
He is very attentive to her.
He visits them? Yes, very often.
No, replied Princess Mary.
To please Moscow girls nowadays one has to be melancholy.
He is very melancholy with Mademoiselle Karágina, said Pierre.
I should like to tell everything to Pierre.
He is kind and generous.
It would be a relief.
He would give me advice.
I don’t know what is the matter with me today.
I was told they are coming soon.
I am also expecting Andrew any day.
I should like them to meet here.
Princess Mary shook her head.
The thing is impossible.
I wish they would come sooner.
I hope to be friends with her.
You have known them a long time, said Princess Mary.
That is all one can say about her.
Is she clever? she asked.
I think not, he said, and yet—yes.
She does not deign to be clever....
Oh no, she is simply enchanting, and that is all.
Princess Mary again shook her head disapprovingly.
I hear they are expected very soon, said Pierre.
She was twenty-seven.
Julie never missed a ball, a promenade, or a play.
Her dresses were always of the latest fashion.
Ah! contre les douleurs il n’y a pas d’autre asile.
* * Death gives relief and death is peaceful.
Ah! from suffering there is no other refuge.
For Borís, Julie played most doleful nocturnes on her harp.
Borís says his soul finds repose at your house.
His leave was expiring.
Then I should advise you...
On the contrary...
Márya Dmítrievna lived alone.
The young ladies’? There to the left.
Get the samovar ready!...
You’re half frozen, I’m sure! Bring some rum for tea!...
You’ll have to make his acquaintance.
Now listen, she said to the count.
The sniveling Anna Mikháylovna? That’s two.
She’s here with her son.
He dined with me on Wednesday.
I suppose you’ll have everything new.
Márya Dmítrievna ordered almost the whole trousseau.
Well, now we’ll talk.
I congratulate you on your betrothed.
Natásha blushed happily.
I like him and all his family.
One wants to do it peacefully and lovingly.
You’re a clever girl and you’ll know how to manage.
Be kind, and use your wits.
Then all will be well.
She wanted nothing more.
She has asked me to bring you two together.
Tomorrow you’ll go with your father to see her.
They can’t help liking me, she thought.
From the first glance Princess Mary did not like Natásha.
She thought her too fashionably dressed, frivolously gay and vain.
Princess Mary looked frightened.
Ah, madam! he began.
Countess Rostóva, if I am not mistaken...
I beg you to excuse me, to excuse me...
I did not know, madam.
I beg you to excuse me...
Mademoiselle Bourienne alone smiled agreeably.
The same thought was meanwhile tormenting Princess Mary.
Natásha glanced at her ironically without knowing why.
She paused, feeling that she was not telling the truth.
Natásha noticed this and guessed its reason.
Sónya stood beside her, kissing her hair.
Natásha, what is it about? she asked.
But if you only knew how offensive it was...
as if I...
Don’t talk about it, Natásha.
I can’t tell you, I don’t know.
No one’s to blame, said Natásha—It’s my fault.
But it all hurts terribly.
Oh, why doesn’t he come?...
She came in to dinner with red eyes.
And his eyes—how I see those eyes! thought Natásha.
No, she’s altogether different.
Natásha and Sónya, holding up their dresses, jumped out quickly.
Through the closed doors the music was already audible.
Natásha, your hair!...
One can see at once that they’re engaged....
And he no doubt is calming her jealousy of me.
Do you recognize him? said he.
Didn’t he vanish somewhere? He did, replied Shinshín.
He was in the Caucasus and ran away from there.
Dólokhov and Anatole Kurágin have turned all our ladies’ heads.
Have you been here long, Countess? he inquired.
I’ll call, I’ll call to kiss your hand.
They say Semënova acts marvelously.
Count Pierre never used to forget us.
Count Rostóv resumed his seat.
Handsome, isn’t she? he whispered to Natásha.
Wonderful! answered Natásha.
She’s a woman one could easily fall in love with.
Natásha too began to look at it.
They all sang something.
I suppose it has to be like this! she thought.
There’s Kurágin! whispered Shinshín.
The first act was over.
The Rostóvs had not seen him since their arrival.
He passed up to the front rows, not noticing anyone.
She turned and their eyes met.
They began waving their arms.
Do make me acquainted with your charming daughters, said she.
I want to become a Moscovite too, now, said Hélène.
I had heard about you from my page, Drubetskóy.
Then other men and women danced with bare legs.
She looked about with pleasure, smiling joyfully.
Isn’t Duport delightful? Hélène asked her.
Oh, yes, replied Natásha.
Natásha knew for certain that he was enraptured by her.
She asked the question and blushed.
Anatole smiled as though to encourage her.
The curtain rose again.
Anatole left the box, serene and gay.
Agitated and flushed she turned round.
He was looking at her with glittering eyes, smiling tenderly.
O God! I am lost! she said to herself.
Everything seemed dark, obscure, and terrible.
He indicated to him Princess Mary and Julie Karágina.
He was not vain.
He did not mind what people thought of him.
Still less could he be accused of ambition.
Natásha had made a strong impression on Kurágin.
Eh? You’d better wait till she’s married....
He had not arrived.
God is the same everywhere.
It was Hélène.
Oh, my enchantress! she cried to the blushing Natásha.
You must come.
You positively must! Between eight and nine.
But anything suits you, my charmer! she remarked.
A smile of pleasure never left Natásha’s face.
Natásha blushed scarlet when she heard this.
How she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty! said Hélène.
You must certainly come.
So it’s all right.
It will divert your thoughts, she added, addressing Natásha.
CHAPTER XIII Count Rostóv took the girls to Countess Bezúkhova’s.
Anatole sat down behind her.
Enthusiastic whispering was audible.
Adorable! divine! delicious! was heard from every side.
You are enchanting...
from the moment I saw you I have never ceased...
She lowered her eyes.
Don’t say such things to me.
I am betrothed and love another, she said rapidly....
She glanced at him.
It’s our turn to begin.
She understood hardly anything that went on that evening.
They danced the écossaise and the Grossvater.
Natalie? I don’t understand.
I have nothing to say, her eyes replied.
One word, just one, for God’s sake! cried Anatole.
Hélène returned with Natásha to the drawing room.
The Rostóvs went away without staying for supper.
After reaching home Natásha did not sleep all night.
Else how could all this have happened? thought she.
CHAPTER XIV Morning came with its cares and bustle.
Márya Dmítrievna appeared, and they were called to breakfast.
Yesterday, as you know, I went to see Prince Bolkónski.
Well, I had a talk with him....
He? He’s crazy...
he did not want to listen.
and wait there.
Oh, no! exclaimed Natásha.
Yes, go back, said Márya Dmítrievna, and wait there.
Count Rostóv approved of this suggestion, appreciating its reasonableness.
That is perfectly true.
It was a letter from Princess Mary.
She has written to you.
But she doesn’t like me, said Natásha.
Don’t talk nonsense! cried Márya Dmítrievna.
Don’t answer like that, my good girl! she said.
Can it be that it is all over? she thought.
But with that one nothing is spoiled.
Only, for Christ’s sake...
There is no other way for me, the letter began.
Love would conquer all.
Natásha, pleading a headache, remained at home.
Open on the table, beside her lay Anatole’s letter.
Sónya picked it up and read it.
Her face was calm, gentle, and happy.
Probably she is offended by it.
Natásha! she said, just audibly.
Natásha awoke and saw Sónya.
Sónya, you’ve read that letter? she demanded.
Yes, answered Sónya softly.
Natásha smiled rapturously.
No, Sónya, I can’t any longer! she said.
I can’t hide it from you any longer.
You know, we love one another! Sónya, darling, he writes...
Sónya stared open-eyed at Natásha, unable to believe her ears.
And Bolkónski? she asked.
You don’t know what love is....
Well, then, are you refusing Prince Andrew? said Sónya.
But I can’t believe it, insisted Sónya.
I don’t understand.
Three days? said Natásha.
It seems to me I’ve loved him a hundred years.
You can’t understand it....
It’s not the same as before.
Yes, his slave! Whatever he orders I shall do.
You don’t understand that.
But think what you are doing, cried Sónya.
I can’t leave it like this.
This secret correspondence...
I told you that I have no will, Natásha replied.
I shall tell! cried Sónya, bursting into tears.
What do you mean? For God’s sake...
If you tell, you are my enemy! declared Natásha.
But what has happened between you? she asked.
I don’t know what the reasons are.
If there were reasons...
But Natásha, guessing her doubts, interrupted her in alarm.
But I can’t live without him! cried Natásha.
Natásha, I don’t understand you.
I don’t want anyone, I don’t love anyone but him.
Sónya burst into sobs and ran from the room.
We have had an explanation today.
What did he say? Natásha became thoughtful.
He asked me what I had promised Bolkónski.
He was glad I was free to refuse him.
Sónya sighed sorrowfully.
But you haven’t refused Bolkónski? said she.
Perhaps I have.
Perhaps all is over between me and Bolkónski.
Wait a bit, Sónya, you’ll understand everything.
I don’t trust him, Natásha.
Why this secrecy? Again, again! interrupted Natásha.
Anger again showed in Natásha’s face.
Natásha did not speak to Sónya again and avoided her.
Sónya knocked at her door.
Natásha did not let her in.
She will run away with him! thought Sónya.
She is capable of anything.
She cried as she said good-by to Uncle, Sónya remembered.
The count is away.
And Uncle is away....
CHAPTER XVI Anatole had lately moved to Dólokhov’s.
Dólokhov was counting the money and noting something down.
Well, he said, Khvóstikov must have two thousand.
Give it to him, then, said Anatole.
There’s still time! Fool, retorted Anatole.
Don’t talk nonsense! If you only knew...
I am speaking seriously.
It’s no joke, this plot you’ve hatched.
Dólokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when Anatole had gone out.
You wait a bit, he called after him.
I’m not joking, I’m talking sense.
Now listen to me.
I’m telling you this for the last time.
Well, thank you for it.
Why, they’ll have you in the criminal court....
Oh, nonsense, nonsense! Anatole ejaculated and again made a grimace.
Isn’t that so? And don’t talk to me, don’t, don’t.
Then, I don’t know....
But why talk nonsense! He glanced at his watch.
It’s time! Anatole went into the back room.
Come and eat something.
I don’t want to, answered Anatole continuing to smile.
Come! Balagá is here.
Anatole rose and went into the dining room.
He had ruined more than one horse in their service.
Real gentlemen! he considered them.
The gentlemen always made him sit down.
I am quite out of horses.
Theodore Iványch! he said, bowing.
Why joke? said the driver, laughing.
Well, sit down.
Yes, sit down! said Dólokhov.
I’ll stand, Theodore Iványch.
The driver’s eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine.
And when are we to start, your excellency? Well...
Anatole looked at his watch.
We’ll start at once.
Eh? Those were horses! Balagá continued the tale.
Well, good-by, Theodore.
Thank you for everything and farewell! said Anatole.
Well, comrades and friends...
he considered for a moment ...
All take glasses; you too, Balagá.
Makárin embraced Anatole with tears in his eyes.
Let’s go! cried Anatole.
Balagá was about to leave the room.
No, stop! said Anatole.
Shut the door; we have first to sit down.
That’s the way.
They shut the door and all sat down.
Now, quick march, lads! said Anatole, rising.
And where’s the fur cloak? asked Dólokhov.
The valet brought a woman’s fox-lined cloak.
Well, good-by, Matrëna, said Anatole, kissing her.
Ah, my revels here are over.
Remember me to Stëshka.
Anatole and Dólokhov got in with him.
Well, are you ready? asked Balagá.
Tproo! Get out of the way! Hi!...
When they reached the gate Dólokhov whistled.
The whistle was answered, and a maidservant ran out.
Dólokhov stayed by the gate.
He was met by Gabriel, Márya Dmítrievna’s gigantic footman.
Kindly step in, my orders are to bring you in.
Kurágin! Come back! shouted Dólokhov.
You shameless good-for-nothing! said she.
I won’t hear a word.
Sónya was sitting sobbing in the corridor.
In my house...
She entered the room with resolute steps.
A nice girl! Very nice! said Márya Dmítrievna.
Let me be!...
What is it to me?...
Natalie! said Márya Dmítrievna.
I wish for your good.
Lie still, stay like that then, I won’t touch you.
I won’t tell you how guilty you are.
You know that yourself.
That’s all the same, continued Márya Dmítrievna.
Well, if he had carried you off...
If you hadn’t interfered...
Natásha had not left her room that morning.
She did not even get up to greet him.
After a moment’s silence Natásha answered: Yes, ill.
Márya Dmítrievna confirmed Natásha’s assurances that nothing had happened.
Yet some fate constantly threw them together.
On the Tverskóy Boulevard a familiar voice called to him.
Pierre! Been back long? someone shouted.
Pierre raised his head.
Yes, indeed, that’s a true sage, thought Pierre.
What has happened? asked Pierre, entering Márya Dmítrievna’s room.
Fine doings! answered Dmítrievna.
He thought of his wife.
Mind, the count knows nothing.
Behave as if you know nothing either, she said.
Pierre met the old count, who seemed nervous and upset.
Troubles, troubles, my dear fellow! he said to Pierre.
I will be frank with you.
Sónya entered the room with an agitated face.
Let him tell you whether I have told the truth.
Has he been married long? she asked.
On your honor?...
Pierre gave his word of honor.
Is he still here? she asked, quickly.
Yes, I have just seen him.
Pierre drove to the Club.
In the Club all was going on as usual.
He asked everyone about Anatole.
It seemed to him essential to see Natásha.
The countess’ drawing room was full of guests.
Ah, Pierre, said the countess going up to her husband.
You don’t know what a plight our Anatole...
If you allow yourself in my drawing room...
Pierre’s face, already pale, became distorted by fury.
When I tell you that I must talk to you!...
Come now, this is stupid.
Did you promise to marry her? I...
I didn’t think of it.
I never promised, because...
Pierre interrupted him.
But how can I?...
Pierre paced the room several times in silence.
Anatole sat at a table frowning and biting his lips.
to deceive, to kidnap....
Though it was tête-à-tête, Anatole continued, still I can’t...
Is it satisfaction you want? said Pierre ironically.
You could at least take back your words.
Pierre involuntarily glanced at the loose button.
And if you require money for your journey...
Next day Anatole left for Petersburg.
Princess Mary came out to meet Pierre.
He says he expected it, she remarked.
Evidently it had to be....
Princess Mary looked at him with astonishment.
Pierre went into the study.
He paused at the sight of Pierre.
His face quivered and immediately assumed a vindictive expression.
He did it all silently and very quickly.
He stood up and coughed.
His face was gloomy and his lips compressed.
Forgive me for troubling you....
Here are her letters and her portrait, said he.
Give this to the countess...
if you see her.
She is very ill, said Pierre.
Then she is here still? said Prince Andrew.
And Prince Kurágin? he added quickly.
He left long ago.
She has been at death’s door.
Prince Andrew laughed disagreeably, again reminding one of his father.
He has gone to Peters...
But I don’t know, said Pierre.
Well, it doesn’t matter, said Prince Andrew.
Pierre took the packet.
Yes, returned Prince Andrew hastily.
But can this be compared...? said Pierre.
of all that! Well, good-by.
The old man seemed livelier than usual.
Ten minutes later Sónya came to Márya Dmítrievna.
Natásha insists on seeing Count Peter Kirílovich, said she.
Márya Dmítrievna only shrugged her shoulders.
Pierre hastened to her.
He is here now: tell him...
I will tell him, answered Pierre; but...
He did not know what to say.
No, I know all is over, she said hurriedly.
No, that can never be.
I’m only tormented by the wrong I have done him.
She trembled all over and sat down on a chair.
I should like to know one thing....
Know what? Natásha’s eyes asked.
I should like to know, did you love...
But I don’t know, don’t know at all....
I shall be happy if it’s in my power...
Pierre grew confused.
Don’t speak to me like that.
He knew he had something more to say to her.
All over? he repeated.
Where to now, your excellency? asked the coachman.
Where to? Pierre asked himself.
It was clear and frosty.
Without each of these causes nothing could have happened.
So all these causes—myriads of causes—coincided to bring it about.
The king’s heart is in the hands of the Lord.
A king is history’s slave.
* Old style.
Now we’ll go into action.
There he is!...
Did you see the Emperor? Vive l’Empereur!...
The little corporal...
Hundreds of Uhlans galloped in after him.
He called for his horse and rode to his quarters.
Quos vult perdere dementat.
There was no general plan of action.
This idea was eagerly received.
The Emperor gave his consent.
The aides-de-camp collected money by subscription.
It was a gay and brilliant fete.
The Emperor noticed her and honored her with a dance.
At midnight dancing was still going on.
They were the third couple.
They were moving toward the door.
There he was stopped by French cavalry sentinels.
* Royalty has its obligations.
but Murat interrupted him.
Davout allowed himself that pleasure when Balashëv was brought in.
Where is your dispatch? he inquired.
Give it to me.
I will send it to the Emperor.
Davout took the packet and read the inscription.
He stood a minute or two, waiting.
Good day, General! said he.
Balashëv recovered himself and began to speak.
The Niemen? repeated Napoleon.
The latter bowed his head respectfully.
Napoleon turned quickly and began to pace the room.
Peace has been concluded...
But Napoleon did not let him speak.
All that, he would have owed to my friendship.
Bagratión alone is a military man.
He knew how Alexander desired to be a military commander.
Your army is grumbling.
I know everything! Napoleon interrupted him.
I know everything.
But what do I care about your allies? said Napoleon.
I have allies—the Poles.
And there will be two hundred thousand of them.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
I have convinced you.
And Napoleon went quickly to the door.
Bessières, Caulaincourt, and Berthier were present at that dinner.
Napoleon met Balashëv cheerfully and amiably.
Balashëv respectfully ventured to disagree with the French Emperor.
Every country has its own character, said he.
Balashëv made no reply and bowed his head in silence.
That I do not...
I’ll drive them out.
She had merely become more self-confident, Prince Andrew thought.
Little Nicholas alone had changed.
I know how she loves and respects you.
Ah, he has passed judgment...
Well, go on! said his son.
So you’ve decided to go, Andrew? asked his sister.
Thank God that I can, replied Prince Andrew.
I am very sorry you can’t.
Why do you say that? replied Princess Mary.
Prince Andrew turned away and began pacing the room.
I understand you (she looked down).
Don’t imagine that sorrow is the work of men.
Men are His tools.
Sorrow is sent by Him, not by men.
Men are His instruments, they are not to blame.
And then you will know the happiness of forgiving.
If I were a woman I would do so, Mary.
That is a woman’s virtue.
And I am off to the army.
Why? I myself don’t know.
The more mistakes that are made the better.
His face was much wrinkled and his eyes deep set.
Pfuel was evidently of that sort.
The Emperor went into the study.
Some disputed his arguments, others defended them.
Why, you yourselves know everything better than I do.
Armfeldt addressed Pfuel in German.
Toll explained to Volkónski in Russian.
Prince Andrew listened and observed in silence.
Bagratión was the best, Napoleon himself admitted that.
To Sónya he wrote separately.
Adored friend of my soul! he wrote.
But this shall be our last separation.
I have come from the staff, Count.
Rostóv looked at him in silence.
And he acted accordingly.
My stockings and shirt...
The rain seems less heavy.
Ilyín went out and Zdrzhinski rode away.
Rostóv, where are you? Here.
What lightning! they called to one another.
Her husband, the doctor, lay asleep behind her.
Dear me, how jolly we are! said Rostóv laughing.
Don’t mess Mary Hendríkhovna’s dress! cried other voices.
A fire was made up in the dilapidated brick stove.
Leave him alone, said Mary Hendríkhovna, smiling timidly and happily.
Too hot! she replied, blushing with pleasure.
This is my cup, said he.
Well, but supposing Mary Hendríkhovna is ‘King’? asked Ilyín.
His face was sad and depressed.
But I’ll send an orderly....
Two of them! said Rostóv.
It was growing lighter and lighter.
The soldiers’ faces were more and more clearly visible.
Everything grew bright and glittered.
The horses began to lather and the men to flush.
Forward by the left.
Walk, march! came the order from in front.
A cannonade began.
He looked around.
Andrew Sevastyánych! said Rostóv.
You know, we could crush them....
A fine thing too! replied the captain, and really...
The dragoons were now close at hand.
Nearly all the French dragoons were galloping back.
The instant he had done this, all Rostóv’s animation vanished.
In front, the French infantry were firing as they ran.
The hussars galloped hastily back with their prisoners.
Ilyín? No, he’s safe.
Something else, resembling remorse, tormented him.
Yes, oh yes, that French officer with the dimple.
Rostóv still had the same indefinite feeling, as of shame.
Why should I kill him? My hand trembled.
And they have given me a St.
I can’t make it out at all.
CHAPTER XVII Natásha was calmer but no happier.
She could not sing.
Something stood sentinel within her and forbade her every joy.
Yet it was necessary to live on.
But this was not enough.
There was no joy in life, yet life was passing.
Before the end of the fast of St.
She was afraid of being late for Matins.
Only, please be particular about it.
She will soon be singing and frolicking about.
She has freshened up very much.
It was a hot July day.
That’s Rostóva, the one who...
But she was always imagining that.
In peace let us pray unto the Lord.
Lord God, I submit myself to Thy will! she thought.
And it seemed to her that God heard her prayer.
And his soul felt calm and peaceful.
L’russe Besuhof made 666.
This discovery excited him.
I have a sackful of letters to parents.
Pierre came early so as to find them alone.
He went up the stairs, puffing and muttering something.
The first person he saw in the house was Natásha.
She was practicing solfa exercises in the music room.
You know Nicholas has received a St.
George’s Cross? I am so proud of him.
Oh yes, I sent that announcement.
Natásha stopped him.
Why should it be? On the contrary...
I believe in you completely.
Pierre replied, that he has nothing to forgive....
If I were in his place...
But she did not give him time to say them.
she said, uttering the word you rapturously—that’s a different thing.
Just then Pétya came running in from the drawing room.
Pétya pulled him by the arm to attract his attention.
Oh yes, your plan.
She says it’s very fine.
Yes, I’ve got it, said Pierre.
The Emperor is to be here tomorrow...
They say we’re already near Smolénsk, replied Pierre.
O Lord, O Lord! exclaimed the count.
There he is, always losing everything! remarked the countess.
But you’ll be late for dinner.
Oh! And my coachman has gone.
Pierre was about to begin reading.
People are being arrested...
said the count.
It’s not the time for it now.
And have you heard? Shinshín asked.
Prince Golítsyn has engaged a master to teach him Russian.
It is becoming dangerous to speak French in the streets.
He looked at the count.
Oh yes, the war, he said.
He comes to despoil our beloved country.
Sónya read painstakingly in her high-pitched voice.
There! Here’s a patriot for you! said Shinshín.
Not a patriot at all, but simply...
Natásha replied in an injured tone.
A joke indeed! put in the count.
Let him but say the word and we’ll all go....
Never mind what it’s for....
That comes of your talking! said she.
But the count had already recovered from his excitement.
Come, come! said he.
Here’s a fine warrior! No! Nonsense! You must study.
It’s not nonsense, Papa.
Fédya Obolénski is younger than I, and he’s going too.
Besides, all the same I can’t study now when...
That’ll do, that’ll do—nonsense....
But you said yourself that we would sacrifice everything.
And I tell you—Peter Kirílych here will also tell you...
Nonsense, I tell you.
Pierre was agitated and undecided.
No, I think I’ll go home.
Home? Why, you meant to spend the evening with us....
Yes, I had forgotten...
I really must go home...
said Pierre hurriedly.
Because it is better for me to come less often...
No, simply I have business....
Why? No, tell me! Natásha began resolutely and suddenly stopped.
They looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces.
Hurrah! was heard on all sides.
No, I can’t petition him myself—that would be too bold.
You’ve crushed the young gentleman! said the clerk.
What are you up to? Gently!...
Pétya no longer thought of presenting his petition.
Hurrah! hurrah! shouted the crowd again.
The people, with Pétya among them, rushed toward the balcony.
Angel! Dear one! Hurrah! Father!...
Several people in the crowd rushed at the coachman.
The great halls were full.
Then all preferred listening to speaking.
Count Ilyá Rostóv smiled blandly and nodded approval.
Pierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement.
Pierre stepped forward and interrupted him.
Excuse me, your excellency, he began.
* Food for cannon.
The nobleman smote his breast.
Several approving voices were heard in the crowd.
Pierre became the latter.
Many spoke eloquently and with originality.
He is the enemy of mankind! cried another.
Allow me to speak....
Gentlemen, you are crushing me!...
I am straight from the palace.
The Emperor has deigned to summon us and the merchants.
The whole consultation passed more than quietly.
Every face expressed respectful, awe-struck curiosity.
Gentlemen! said the Emperor with a quivering voice.
Yes, most precious...
a royal word, said Count Rostóv, with a sob.
There he remained about ten minutes.
Both were weeping.
Next day the Emperor left Moscow.
All the facts are in flat contradiction to such conjectures.
Everything came about fortuitously.
The armies were divided at the commencement of the campaign.
Barclay stood for caution.
The Tsarévich hinted at treachery and demanded a general engagement.
By the Emperor’s orders Bagratión reported direct to him.
I cannot stand it here.
I confess I do not want to.
Preparations were made to fight the French before Smolénsk.
A general was sent to survey the position.
Well? Are you satisfied now? said he.
It hurts me, it hurts.
I’m old and weak and this is what you wanted.
He was ill and did not leave his study.
Tíkhon alone attended him.
and so on.
That must be very interesting, said Dessalles.
Prince Andrew is in a position to know...
Oh, very interesting! said Mademoiselle Bourienne.
You know—under the paperweight on the little table.
Mademoiselle Bourienne jumped up eagerly.
No, don’t! he exclaimed with a frown.
You go, Michael Ivánovich.
Michael Ivánovich rose and went to the study.
They can’t do anything...
always make some muddle, he muttered.
Ha ha ha! The theater of war! said the prince.
When the snow melts they’ll sink in the Polish swamps.
But, Prince, Dessalles began timidly, the letter mentions Vítebsk....
Ah, the letter? Yes...
replied the prince peevishly.
His face suddenly took on a morose expression.
Yes, he writes that the French were beaten at...
what river is it? Dessalles dropped his eyes.
The prince says nothing about that, he remarked gently.
Doesn’t he? But I didn’t invent it myself.
No one spoke for a long time.
He’s worrying very much about the new building.
First, notepaper—do you hear? Eight quires, like this sample, gilt-edged...
it must be exactly like the sample.
Varnish, sealing wax, as in Michael Ivánovich’s list.
Alpátych made a slight movement.
Alpátych went out.
He went about looking at every corner.
This happened to him almost every night.
He opened his eyes as they were closing.
The bolts? No, I told him about them.
No, it was something, something in the drawing room.
Princess Mary talked some nonsense.
Dessalles, that fool, said something.
Something in my pocket—can’t remember....
Yes, I know, Prince Andrew’s letter! Princess Mary read it.
Dessalles said something about Vítebsk.
Now I’ll read it.
No, no, I don’t want anything! he shouted.
If there is anything...
On seeing Alpátych he went up to him.
You’re welcome, Yákov Alpátych.
Why are they leaving the town? asked Alpátych.
That’s what I say.
Folks are foolish! Always afraid of the French.
Women’s fuss, women’s fuss! said Alpátych.
Just what I think, Yákov Alpátych.
All night long troops were moving past the inn.
A good day for harvesting, thought Alpátych.
Oh come, that’s enough! said the other.
Yes, go and find out! shouted the angry gentleman.
They’ve brought us all to ruin...
the brigands! he repeated, and descended the porch steps.
Alpátych swayed his head and went upstairs.
and he handed a paper to Alpátych.
I am just starting myself.
The Governor’s face expressed terror.
The coachman was asleep.
He’s done her to death.
Killed the mistress!...
dragged her about so!...
What for? asked Alpátych.
She kept begging to go away.
Going already? said he.
With our business, how can we get away? said Ferapóntov.
Will you have some tea? he added.
Ours must have got the best of it.
The orders were not to let them in.
So we’re in force, it seems....
It was by now late in the afternoon.
The cook and a shop assistant came to the gate.
Several people came round the corner talking eagerly.
What force! remarked one.
That’s grand, it bucks one up! laughed the first.
Alpátych was getting into his trap.
The innkeeper stood at the gate.
The loudest sound in that crowd was her wailing.
Five minutes later no one remained in the street.
Toward dusk the cannonade began to subside.
Alpátych left the cellar and stopped in the doorway.
The cook’s moans had now subsided.
Several of them ran into Ferapóntov’s yard before Alpátych’s eyes.
Alpátych went out to the gate.
A retreating regiment, thronging and hurrying, blocked the street.
Noticing him, an officer said: The town is being abandoned.
Just then Ferapóntov returned and entered his shop.
Alpátych, I’ll set the place on fire myself.
We’re done for!...
and Ferapóntov ran into the yard.
Night had come.
This fire was already burning itself out.
Alpátych! a familiar voice suddenly hailed the old man.
Why are you here? he asked.
your excellency, stammered Alpátych and broke into sobs.
Are we really lost? Master!...
Why are you here? Prince Andrew repeated.
Are we really quite lost, your excellency? he asked again.
He wrote to his sister: Smolénsk is being abandoned.
Set off immediately for Moscow.
Let me know at once when you will start.
Send by special messenger to Usvyázh.
You must please excuse me, he went on apologetically.
Something cracked in the flames.
There was another terrible crash and something huge collapsed.
It’s fine! That’s the owner himself, cried several voices.
Heat and drought had continued for more than three weeks.
Heavy night dews alone refreshed the earth.
The unreaped corn was scorched and shed its grain.
The marshes dried up.
As soon as day dawned the march began.
They marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses and mouths.
He rode to the keeper’s lodge.
He called for Tarás the gardener, but no one replied.
Prince Andrew rode up to the house.
Everything precious and valuable had been removed to Boguchárovo.
Seventy quarters of grain had also been carted away.
Yes, let them have it, replied Prince Andrew.
He is my refuge! His will be done! he exclaimed.
Well, good-by! said Prince Andrew, bending over to Alpátych.
Alpátych clung to Prince Andrew’s leg and burst into sobs.
He could not resist looking at them once more.
It was past one o’clock.
There was no wind.
It’s dirty, replied Prince Andrew, making a grimace.
The prince wants to bathe.
Our troops fought, and are fighting, as never before.
There is a rumor that you are thinking of peace.
One man ought to be in command, and not two.
I am really frantic with vexation; forgive my writing boldly.
So I write you frankly: call out the militia.
That life of the salons is unchanging.
They did not listen to me.
It’s all this mania for opposition, he went on.
But he retrieved his mistake at once.
This was quite correct on the twenty-fourth of July.
He sees well enough, he added.
God grant it! God grant it! said Anna Pávlovna.
From Vyázma Napoleon ordered a direct advance on Moscow.
Well? asked Napoleon.
He is a very shrewd and garrulous fellow.
He wished to talk to him himself.
You are a Cossack? Yes, a Cossack, your Honor.
Much of it true.
The young Cossack made his mighty interlocutor smile, says Thiers.
* * Child of the Don.
The fact was accordingly conveyed to Lavrúshka.
He repeated every injustice he had ever inflicted on her.
His calèche was already at the door.
It was impossible to make out what he wanted.
He was unconscious and lay like a distorted corpse.
He was evidently suffering both physically and mentally.
There was no hope of recovery.
It was becoming dangerous to remain in Boguchárovo.
The princess decided to leave on the fifteenth.
But she drove these thoughts away with disgust.
Toward morning he became quiet and she fell asleep.
She woke late.
It was a warm, gray morning.
The doctor came downstairs and went out to her.
He is a little better today, said he.
I was looking for you.
One can make out something of what he is saying.
His head is clearer.
Come in, he is asking for you....
Come, said the doctor.
He seemed altogether so thin, small, and pathetic.
Princess Mary went up and kissed his hand.
Straining all her faculties Princess Mary looked at him.
He said something, repeating the same words several times.
he repeated several times.
It was quite impossible to understand these sounds.
My mind, my mind aches? questioned Princess Mary.
He moved his hand over her hair.
I have been calling you all night...
he brought out.
If only I had known...
she said through her tears.
I was afraid to come in.
He pressed her hand.
He was silent awhile.
for all, for all...
and tears began to flow from his eyes.
He himself seemed aware that his demand was meaningless.
So at least it seemed to Princess Mary.
I have a letter from him, she replied.
He glanced at her with timid surprise.
Where is he? He’s with the army, Father, at Smolénsk.
He closed his eyes and remained silent a long time.
Yes, he said, softly and distinctly.
Russia has perished.
They’ve destroyed her.
Again he closed his eyes.
Put on your white dress.
I like it, was what he said.
Princess Mary stayed on the veranda.
The day had cleared, it was hot and sunny.
I wished to be at peace....
Go away, Princess! Go away...
Please come, Princess...
The Prince, said Dunyásha in a breaking voice.
The doctor tried to stop her.
She pushed him aside and ran to her father’s door.
In the room were her nurse and other women.
But she stepped back immediately.
They differed from them in speech, dress, and disposition.
They were called steppe peasants.
Yet there was no time to waste.
The peasants feared him more than they did their master.
Alpátych looked intently at Dron and frowned.
Now just listen, Drónushka, said he.
Don’t talk nonsense to me.
Anyone who stays is a traitor to the Tsar.
Alpátych was not satisfied with this reply.
The power is in your hands, Dron rejoined sadly.
What is it you have got into your heads, eh?...
They’re quite beside themselves; I have already told them...
‘Told them,’ I dare say! said Alpátych.
Are they drinking? he asked abruptly.
Quite beside themselves, Yákov Alpátych; they’ve fetched another barrel.
Alpátych did not insist further.
Meanwhile he went himself to the police authorities.
She lay for a long time in that position.
The flow of her thoughts suddenly stopped.
She looked up.
It was Mademoiselle Bourienne in a black dress and weepers.
The princess looked up at her.
Princess Mary did not answer.
It would be dangerous to move now.
Alpátych did say something about going....
I’ve spoken to him.
She handed this to the princess.
From whom did you get this? she asked.
They, the French, would settle in this house: M.
Mademoiselle Bourienne would do the honors of Boguchárovo for him.
Involuntarily she thought their thoughts and felt their feelings.
she began, but could not go on.
They were silent for a while.
Dear friend, I can do nothing.
I understand nothing.
Why are there none? asked the princess.
It’s all God’s scourge, said Dron.
We’ve nothing, we’ve been ruined.
Princess Mary listened attentively to what he told her.
The peasants are ruined? They have no bread? she asked.
They’re dying of hunger, said Dron.
It’s not a case of carting.
But we have grain belonging to my brother? she said.
The landlord’s grain is all safe, replied Dron proudly.
Our prince did not order it to be sold.
Dron made no answer but sighed deeply.
Give them that corn if there is enough of it.
Distribute it all.
We do not grudge them anything.
Tell them so.
Dron looked intently at the princess while she was speaking.
I have served twenty-three years and have done no wrong.
But I never told them to come, said Princess Mary.
I only told Dron to let them have the grain.
and please don’t...
What is a trick? asked Princess Mary in surprise.
You’re making some mistake.
I never ordered them to go away, said Princess Mary.
But I never sent for them, declared the princess.
You must have given my message wrong.
Dron only sighed in reply.
If you order it they will go away, said he.
Drónushka tells me that the war has ruined you.
I am myself going away because it is dangerous here...
the enemy is near...
You shall be given food and lodging.
The princess stopped.
Sighs were the only sound heard in the crowd.
Again she paused.
No one broke the silence.
But why not? asked the princess.
No one answered.
Why should we give up everything? We don’t agree.
We are sorry for you, but we’re not willing.
Go away yourself, alone...
came from various sides of the crowd.
We’re not willing.
Let them ruin us! We won’t take your grain.
We don’t agree.
She felt strange and awkward.
Now she could remember it and weep or pray.
After sunset the wind had dropped.
The night was calm and fresh.
He had always thought what he said then.
Evidently he had wanted to talk.
Why didn’t I enter the room? she thought.
While talking to Tíkhon he asked about me twice.
She now saw his face before her.
Dear-est! she repeated again.
Dunyásha, she whispered.
Rostóv and Ilyín were in the merriest of moods.
You’re first! cried Ilyín, flushed.
Fine fellows! said Rostóv laughing.
Who do you belong to? he asked.
Then you are Russians? the peasant asked again.
Very large, answered Rostóv.
But why have you collected here? he added.
She’ll be ours! said Lavrúshka to Ilyín, winking.
Ah, Yákov Alpátych...
Rostóv looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled.
What’s the matter? he asked.
Impossible! exclaimed Rostóv.
This meeting immediately struck Rostóv as a romantic event.
There were tears in Rostóv’s eyes.
Princess Mary understood this and appreciated his delicacy.
She suddenly began to cry.
Excuse me! she said.
But on glancing at Rostóv’s face Ilyín stopped short.
Decision? What decision? Old dotard!...
I’ll flay you all alive!...
To be sure, we all have to die.
I’m not against the commune, said Dron.
That’s it—not against it! You’ve filled your belly....
The two tall peasants had their say.
The Elder? What do you want with him?...
Caps off, traitors! shouted Rostóv in a wrathful voice.
Where’s the Elder? he cried furiously.
He wants the Elder!...
Where’s the Elder? demanded Rostóv in a loud voice.
It’s all nonsense....
The two drunken peasants followed them.
Aye, when I look at you!...
said one of them to Karp.
Let it all be done properly, according to rule.
Don’t catch up against it! It’s heavy, lads—solid books.
Well, supposing I do love him? thought Princess Mary.
You’re also waiting for the commander in chief? said he.
They say he weceives evewyone, thank God!...
As it was, devil only knows what was happening.
We kept wetweating and wetweating.
Did you take part in the campaign? he asked.
I belong to the province of Smolénsk.
So you are Pwince Andwew Bolkónski? He swayed his head.
He began explaining his plan to Prince Andrew.
They can’t hold all that line.
I will undertake to bweak thwough.
Sounds of hoofs and shouts were nearing the village.
A huge suite of generals rode behind him.
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! shouted those behind him.
whew! he whistled, and again glanced at Prince Andrew.
Come! Come with me, we’ll have a talk, said he.
Denísov came from those parts and knew the country well.
He is my uncle, your Sewene Highness.
Ah, we were friends, said Kutúzov cheerfully.
He made a grimace....
I’ll look at them here, said he.
She’s very pretty, added the adjutant with a smile.
At those words Kutúzov looked round.
Into the stove...
One can’t get on without it.
Oh, this German precision! he muttered, shaking his head.
Well, sit down, sit down here.
Let’s have a talk, said Kutúzov.
It’s sad, very sad.
Kutúzov glanced inquiringly at him.
I should be sorry to leave the regiment.
He cut Bolkónski short.
I am sorry, for I need you.
Advisers are always plentiful, but men are not.
I remember you at Austerlitz....
Go your way and God be with you.
but everything came at the right time.
Tout vient à point à celui qui sait attendre.
* And there were as many advisers there as here...
Ah, those advisers! said he.
Everything in haste, but more haste, less speed.
Kámenski would have been lost if he had not died.
He stormed fortresses with thirty thousand men.
But shan’t we have to accept battle? remarked Prince Andrew.
We shall if everybody wants it; it can’t be helped....
* Some want a thing—others don’t.
What’s one to do? he asked, evidently expecting an answer.
* Don’t see it that way, that’s the trouble.
* (2) When in doubt, my dear fellow, do nothing.
Good-by, my dear boy.
He will not bring in any plan of his own.
He will not hinder anything useful nor allow anything harmful.
So it was now with the inhabitants of Moscow.
Bezúkhov est ridicule, but he is so kind and good-natured.
I am so sick of it.
And he is so unreasonable, the count himself I mean.
He asks too much.
Though it is madness to buy anything in Moscow now.
Why? asked Julie.
A kindly old man but not up to much.
They are waiting for their younger son, Pierre replied.
I met them the day before yesterday at the Arkhárovs’.
Natalie has recovered her looks and is brighter.
She sang a song.
What knights? What do you mean? demanded Pierre, blushing.
I know you were friendly with Natalie, and so...
but I was always more friendly with Véra—that dear Véra.
But I cannot understand the cruelty...
I spent the evening with her yesterday.
Well, and how is she? asked Pierre.
She is well, but sad.
He rushed in and saved her....
Another romance, said the militia officer.
Catiche is one and Princess Bolkónskaya another.
Pierre pondered over these broadsheets.
Come in, come in! he added to the princess.
The two younger ones had both married.
You know some decision must be come to.
At this rate they will soon begin beating us.
One can’t walk in the streets.
Whatever I may be, I can’t live under Bonaparte’s rule.
If you don’t want to do this...
But I will, I’ll give the order at once.
Muttering to herself, she sat down on a chair.
But you have been misinformed, said Pierre.
See! I’ve just been reading...
He showed her the broadsheet.
Oh, that count of yours! said the princess malevolently.
Oh, but it’s so...
Pierre listened to him, scarcely able to repress a smile.
Well then, sell it, said he.
Hardly anyone he knew was left in town.
Julie had gone, and so had Princess Mary.
I have informed him of the matter.
Another criminal, thin and pale, stood near.
Judging by their faces they were both Frenchmen.
He’s cook to some prince.
To the Governor’s, as you ordered, answered the coachman.
At dawn next day Pierre was approaching Mozháysk.
It was full of officers.
His nose and mouth were twisted to one side.
This soldier was looking at the cathedral and crossing himself.
is my head so keen, Living in a foreign land...
they sang their soldiers’ dance song.
Oh, the coxcombs! he muttered reproachfully.
No distinctions made nowadays....
This was one of the head army doctors.
Well, you know, I wanted to see...
Yes, yes, there will be something to see....
The doctor advised him to apply direct to Kutúzov.
That’s what you must do.
The doctor seemed tired and in a hurry.
You think so?...
The position? repeated the doctor.
Well, that’s not my line.
Go up the hillock and you’ll see.
Can one see from there?...
If you would...
But the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his gig.
I’m galloping to the commander of the corps.
How do matters stand?...
You know, Count, there’ll be a battle tomorrow.
Pierre drove on toward Górki.
Two officers were standing on the knoll, directing the men.
It was about eleven o’clock.
This was Borodinó.
Borodinó, the other corrected him.
Are those our men there? Pierre inquired.
There they are, there...
you can see them.
Where? Where? asked Pierre.
One can see them with the naked eye...
Ah, those are the French! And over there?...
Those are ours.
Ah, ours! And there?...
That’s his again, said the officer.
That’s where one crosses the Kolochá.
That’s our center.
The left flank...
here the officer paused.
Well, you see, that’s difficult to explain....
But the battle will hardly be there.
Gabions must be sent for, said he sternly.
Well, send number three company again, the officer replied hurriedly.
There they are...
bringing her, coming...
There they are...
They’ll be here in a minute...
A church procession was coming up the hill from Borodinó.
From behind them came the sound of church singing.
Soldiers and militiamen ran bareheaded past Pierre toward the procession.
They are bringing her, our Protectress!...
The Iberian Mother of God! someone cried.
The Smolénsk Mother of God, another corrected him.
The singing did not sound loud under the open sky.
A bald general with a St.
Behind Kutúzov was Bennigsen and the suite.
His white head twitched with the effort.
CHAPTER XXII Staggering amid the crush, Pierre looked about him.
Pierre looked round.
An immense and brilliant suite surrounded him.
The icon was carried further, accompanied by the throng.
Pierre stopped some thirty paces from Kutúzov, talking to Borís.
This is what you must do, said Borís.
I will do the honors of the camp to you.
We are just going to the left flank.
But I should like to see the right flank.
They say it’s very strong, said Pierre.
It is not at all what Count Bennigsen intended.
He meant to fortify that knoll quite differently, but...
Yes, exactly; the left flank is now extremely strong.
So Borís was full of nervous vivacity all day.
Kutúzov noticed Pierre’s figure and the group gathered round him.
Call him to me, said Kutúzov.
But a militiaman got there before him.
It was Dólokhov.
How did that fellow get here? asked Pierre.
He’s a creature that wriggles in anywhere! was the answer.
He has been degraded, you know.
Now he wants to bob up again.
He’s a brave fellow.
Pierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to Kutúzov.
Dólokhov was saying.
Perhaps I may prove useful to your Serene Highness.
What are you saying about the militia? he asked Borís.
A matchless people! he repeated with a sigh.
So you want to smell gunpowder? he said to Pierre.
Yes, it’s a pleasant smell.
Is she well? My quarters are at your service.
those verses of Márin’s...
Recite them, recite them! said he, evidently preparing to laugh.
I beg you to forgive me.
It will interest you, said he.
Yes, very much, replied Pierre.
* A kind of entrenchment.
He could make nothing of it.
Some of the generals expressed the same opinion.
But it was much simpler really....
It was all very simple and horrible.
Princess Mary says it is a trial sent from above.
I shall not exist....
to be killed tomorrow...
That I should not exist...
That all this should still be, but no me....
A cold shiver ran down his spine.
After he had returned, voices were heard outside the shed.
Who’s that? he cried.
You? What a surprise! said he.
I have come...
I wish to see the battle.
Yes, they have.
Julie Drubetskáya told me so.
I went to see them, but missed them.
They have gone to your estate near Moscow.
Seats were brought in and so was the tea.
Yes—that is, how do you mean? said Pierre.
And tell me your opinion of Barclay de Tolly.
In Moscow they are saying heaven knows what about him....
Why so? asked Pierre.
But we daren’t.
But when his Serenity took command everything became straightforward.
Now we see light....
Pierre put the same question to Prince Andrew.
How can I explain?...
So it has been with Barclay.
He is an honest and very punctilious German.
And they say he’s a skillful commander, rejoined Pierre.
A skillful commander? replied Pierre.
Why, one who foresees all contingencies...
and foresees the adversary’s intentions.
Pierre looked at him in surprise.
‘We’ve lost, so let us run,’ and we ran.
That’s all nonsense, there’s nothing of the kind.
They are only concerned with their own petty interests.
At such a moment? said Pierre reproachfully.
At such a moment! Prince Andrew repeated.
All were silent.
The officers rose.
* The war must be extended widely.
I cannot sufficiently commend that view.
Oh, no, agreed the other.
Fine teachers! and again his voice grew shrill.
So you think we shall win tomorrow’s battle? asked Pierre.
Yes, yes, answered Prince Andrew absently.
They are my enemies.
In my opinion they are all criminals.
And so thinks Timókhin and the whole army.
We ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously.
The military calling is the most highly honored.
I see that I have begun to understand too much.
Ah, well, it’s not for long! he added.
However, you’re sleepy, and it’s time for me to sleep.
Go back to Górki! said Prince Andrew suddenly.
Good-by, be off! he shouted.
Whether we meet again or not...
and turning away hurriedly he entered the shed.
No, he does not want it! Pierre concluded.
He closed his eyes.
One picture succeeded another in his imagination.
On one of them he dwelt long and joyfully.
He vividly recalled an evening in Petersburg.
and he had such kind...
I understood her, he thought.
loved so strongly and happily...
and suddenly he remembered how his love had ended.
He did not need anything of that kind.
He neither saw nor understood anything of the sort.
Donning his court uniform, M.
Napoleon, frowning, looked at him from under his brows.
No prisoners! said he, repeating the aide-de-camp’s words.
They are forcing us to exterminate them.
So much the worse for the Russian army....
The result of that battle had been deplorable.
I must make up for that in Moscow, said Napoleon.
Napoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his ear.
You have hurried here.
I am very glad.
Again he honored him by touching his ear.
You surely did not expect to see that Asiatic capital.
You will have a pleasant journey.
And while he was doing M.
Victory depends on you.
Behave as you did at Austerlitz, Friedland, Vítebsk, and Smolénsk.
The Imperial Camp near Mozháysk, September, 6, 1812.
Not one of these was, or could be, carried out.
Bartholomew was due to Charles IX’s stomach being deranged.
That was all done by the soldiers.
Therefore it was not he who killed people.
He nodded approval.
The adjutant in attendance came into the tent.
Without doubt, sire, replied Rapp.
Napoleon looked at him.
The wine is drawn and must be drunk.
This poor army! he suddenly remarked.
It has diminished greatly since Smolénsk.
Fortune is frankly a courtesan, Rapp.
Yes, sire, replied Rapp.
An attendant came in with punch.
This cold is tiresome.
What can doctors cure? One can’t cure anything.
Our body is a machine for living.
It is organized for that, it is its nature.
Do you know, Rapp, what military art is? asked he.
Rapp made no reply.
Tomorrow we shall have to deal with Kutúzov! said Napoleon.
We shall see! He looked at his watch.
It was still only four o’clock.
He did not feel sleepy.
The man answered the question.
Napoleon nodded and walked away.
At half-past five Napoleon rode to the village of Shevárdino.
Some minutes passed.
The game had begun.
Hear the firing, said the groom, a discharged soldier.
Pierre dressed hastily and ran out to the porch.
Outside all was bright, fresh, dewy, and cheerful.
The roar of guns sounded more distinct outside.
It’s time, Count; it’s time! cried the adjutant.
Nearer at hand glittered golden cornfields interspersed with copses.
Go, my dear fellow, go...
The general mounted a horse a Cossack had brought him.
Pierre rode up to them.
To the left!...
Keep to the right! the men shouted to him.
How have you got here? he said, and galloped on.
What’s happening here? May I come with you? he asked.
Still inquisitive? Yes, yes, assented Pierre.
But the adjutant turned his horse about and rode on.
Really? said Pierre.
Where is that? Come along with me to our knoll.
she’s wounded! said the adjutant.
In the off foreleg above the knee.
A bullet, no doubt.
Don’t trouble about me, said Pierre.
Pierre went to the battery and the adjutant rode on.
A little behind the guns stood infantry.
You must not be here.
Are you afraid, then? said Pierre.
What else do you expect? answered the soldier.
One can’t help being afraid, he said laughing.
It’s the business of us soldiers.
Mind your own business, an old sergeant shouted at them.
This was followed by a burst of laughter.
Projectiles began to fall still more frequently in the battery.
Several men were lying about who had not been removed.
No one any longer took notice of Pierre.
Pierre standing beside the commanding officer.
Are we to continue firing? he asked.
Everything became strange, confused, and misty in Pierre’s eyes.
Some militiamen who were entering the battery ran back.
All with grapeshot! shouted the officer.
I’ll go, said Pierre.
Wait! he shouted.
Pierre ran down the slope.
Suddenly a terrible concussion threw him backwards to the ground.
He had no time to realize who these men were.
He also saw something else that was strange.
The officer, dropping his sword, seized Pierre by his collar.
Pierre too bent his head and let his hands fall.
Pierre ran down the slope once more.
For the most part things happened contrary to their orders.
The generals re-formed them, but their numbers constantly decreased.
Reinforcements! thought Napoleon to himself.
It was Belliard.
Sire, the prince...
began the adjutant.
Asks for reinforcements? said Napoleon with an angry gesture.
Napoleon nodded assent.
Napoleon gazed silently in that direction.
No! he suddenly said to Berthier.
I can’t send Claparède.
Send Friant’s division.
Napoleon sat on a campstool, wrapped in thought.
Napoleon silently shook his head in negation.
exclaimed Napoleon suddenly and morosely, and turned aside.
But now something strange was happening to his troops.
All this was possible.
What? What do you say? asked Napoleon.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
He mounted and rode toward Semënovsk.
They were Russians.
Napoleon bowed his head and remained silent a long time.
Yes, yes, do that, he replied to various proposals.
Kutúzov groaned and swayed his head.
Wait a little, gentlemen, said he.
Still, it is better to wait before we rejoice.
Toward three o’clock the French attacks ceased.
Dinner was brought him.
The troops are in complete disorder....
You have seen? You have seen?...
Frowning and rising quickly, he went up to Wolzogen.
how dare you!...
Kaysárov! Kutúzov called to his adjutant.
All alike were taciturn and morose.
All seemed fully absorbed in these pursuits.
Hey, look at the trace horse!...
Get her leg out! She’ll fall....
Yells and shrieks of laughter rose from the whole regiment.
Everything went on of itself.
Nothing remained of the previous day’s thoughts.
He thought of nothing.
Here it comes...
One, another! Again! It has hit....
He stopped and looked at the ranks.
No, it has gone over.
A chill ran down his back.
Again he glanced at the ranks.
Adjutant! he shouted.
Order them not to crowd together.
The adjutant, having obeyed this instruction, approached Prince Andrew.
From the other side a battalion commander rode up.
The horse’s terror infected the men.
Prince Andrew hesitated.
I cannot, I do not wish to die.
I love life—I love this grass, this earth, this air....
It’s shameful, sir! he said to the adjutant.
He did not finish speaking.
Several officers ran up to him.
Keep in step! Ah...
Get into step, Fëdor...
I say, Fëdor! said the foremost peasant.
In the wood, wagons and horses were standing.
Some were delirious.
But isn’t it all the same now? thought he.
He evidently wanted a little respite.
Murmurs arose among the wounded who were waiting.
There were three operating tables in the tent.
The man was sobbing and choking convulsively.
He glanced at Prince Andrew’s face and quickly turned away.
Water was being sprinkled on his face.
Show it to me....
Hearing those moans Prince Andrew wanted to weep.
Oh! Oh, ooh! he sobbed, like a woman.
Anatole was sobbing painfully.
But now it is too late.
They want more!...
said Napoleon in a hoarse voice.
Sire? asked the adjutant who had not heard the remark.
They want more! croaked Napoleon frowning.
Those ideas were stolen from me.
Others held their ground and continued to fire.
But the French did not make that effort.
It could not be.
The moral force of the attacking French army was exhausted.
This problem seemed to the ancients insoluble.
History must do the same.
And attempts in this direction have already been made.
At Borodinó a collision took place.
The French did not move.
Kutúzov reported so to the Emperor.
But even that he cannot do.
Events and time do not wait.
An order must be given him at once, that instant.
The conversations all dealt with public questions.
A sixth group was talking absolute nonsense.
Kutúzov’s expression grew more and more preoccupied and gloomy.
This Kutúzov knew well.
He called the most important generals to him.
He had a St.
George’s Cross round his neck and looked pale and ill.
All eyes were gazing at him.
Malásha too looked at Granddad.
The question is that of saving Russia.
The discussion began.
Bennigsen did not yet consider his game lost.
Ermólov, Dokhtúrov, and Raévski agreed with Bennigsen.
Gentlemen, said Kutúzov, I cannot approve of the count’s plan.
They all looked at him.
Gentlemen, I have heard your views.
Some of you will not agree with me.
You should take some rest, your Serene Highness, replied Schneider.
They shall too, if only...
You won’t deign to demean yourself by marrying me, you...
said Hélène, beginning to cry.
But the law, religion...
said the prince, already yielding.
The law, religion...
* Lay member of the Society of Jesus.
It was explained to her that this was la grâce.
After that a long-frocked abbé was brought to her.
The scent of flowers came in at the window.
That marriage lacked the dual significance it should have had.
Yet in spite of this your vow was binding.
You swerved from it.
But the question is again a twofold one: firstly...
I have heard of certain projects concerning...
You have suffered so much....
But, my dear child, consult only your own heart.
You are not taking me unawares, you know, said he.
Une maîtresse-femme! * That’s what is called putting things squarely.
* A masterly woman.
He will do anything for me.
Bilíbin puckered his skin in preparation for something witty.
Even divorce you? said he.
Ah, Maman, ne dites pas de bêtises.
Vous ne comprenez rien.
* Oh, Mamma, don’t talk nonsense! You don’t understand anything.
In my position I have obligations.
But, my dear....
* Countess, there is mercy for every sin.
The old princess rose respectfully and curtsied.
Dusk had fallen, and the roar of guns died away.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
Pierre sat up and sighed.
I came to the battle and have lost them.
There now! said one of the soldiers.
Another shook his head.
You’re a gentleman, aren’t you? Yes.
And what’s your name? Peter Kirílych.
Your excellency! he said.
The soldiers stopped.
So you’ve found your folk? said one of them.
No, better not! said another, inner voice.
All was tranquil in the yard.
Yes, that is he! It is my benefactor.
But he died! thought Pierre.
It is dawn, thought Pierre.
But that’s not what I want.
I want to hear and understand my benefactor’s words.
And they are simple.
They do not talk, but act.
The spoken word is silver but the unspoken is golden.
To unite all? he asked himself.
No, not to unite.
Yes, one must harness, it is time to harness.
We must harness, it is time to harness....
The sun shone straight into Pierre’s face.
CHAPTER X On the thirtieth of August Pierre reached Moscow.
We have been looking for you everywhere, said the adjutant.
The count wants to see you particularly.
They all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy.
After greeting Pierre they continued their conversation.
But you see what he writes...
That’s another matter.
That’s necessary for the people, said the first.
What is it? asked Pierre.
Oh, it’s a fresh broadsheet.
Pierre took it and began reading.
That will help them to get well quicker.
I have heard nothing, Pierre replied unconcernedly.
I only say what I heard.
I expect it’s nonsense....
Possibly, remarked Pierre, looking about him absent-mindedly.
Perhaps you have heard of that affair with the proclamation.
It’s a complicated story, you know, said the adjutant.
That proclamation appeared about two months ago.
The count was informed of it.
He gave orders to investigate the matter.
Gabriel Ivánovich here made the inquiries.
The proclamation had passed through exactly sixty-three hands.
He could only have had it from the Postmaster.
But evidently they had come to some understanding.
Not at all, rejoined the adjutant in dismay.
But the point is that the count was much annoyed.
Now the father has come to intercede for him.
That’s the sort of fellow he is.
We have heard of your prowess.
But that’s not the point.
Pierre remained silent.
Yes, I am a Mason, Pierre replied.
Speránski and Magnítski have been deported to their proper place.
But what did Klyucharëv do wrong, Count? asked Pierre.
My head is sometimes in a whirl.
The count frowned.
A word of friendly advice, mon cher.
Happy he who has ears to hear.
Good-by, my dear fellow.
When he reached home it was already getting dark.
They, the soldiers at the battery, Prince Andrew killed...
that old man...
Simplicity is submission to God.
Suffering is necessary...
the meaning of all...
one must harness...
my wife is getting married...
One must forget and understand...
On the twenty-eighth of August he arrived.
But of late Sónya had been particularly sad and silent.
It was very bitter for her.
The count had been out since morning.
Natásha got up and looked out of the window.
Then you have nobody in Moscow? she was saying.
You would be more comfortable somewhere in a house...
in ours, for instance...
the family are leaving.
Here is our commanding officer...
May the wounded men stay in our house? she asked.
Oh yes, why not? They may, he said.
He says they may! whispered Natásha.
Your Papa must be told, though, said Mávra Kuzmínichna.
They can have all our half of the house.
Well, I’ll ask.
Will you let them come? They have nowhere to go.
Natásha laughed, and the countess too smiled slightly.
I knew you’d give permission...
We’ve stayed too long! said the count with involuntary vexation.
The Club is closed and the police are leaving.
Of course it is, he answered absently.
That’s not the point.
Without any pretense she was now afraid of everything.
Pétya directed things in the yard.
Sónya, wait a bit—we’ll pack everything into these, said Natásha.
No, wait a minute, please.
What a young lady she is! remarked the major-domo.
But Natásha would not give in.
That’s enough, Natásha, said Sónya.
Now press, Pétya! Press, Vasílich, press hard! she cried.
But this only lasted a moment.
Sónya and Natásha slept in the sitting room without undressing.
Mávra Kuzmínichna concluded that he was a very important man.
Please come in here.
Well, perhaps, said he with a sigh.
Come in, said Mávra Kuzmínichna.
Is he very ill? she asked.
The attendant made a hopeless gesture.
All right! said the doctor.
O, Lord Jesus Christ! she murmured.
The masters won’t object...
This wounded man was Prince Andrew Bolkónski.
CHAPTER XV Moscow’s last day had come.
It was a clear bright autumn day, a Sunday.
Nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the city.
Prices too that day indicated the state of affairs.
So thought the major-domo on his master’s behalf.
In the yard stood the carts ready corded.
The carriages were at the front porch.
Well, that’s right.
Count, be so good as to allow me...
I shall be all right on a loaded cart....
Oh, yes, yes, yes! said the count hastily.
I shall be very pleased, very pleased.
Vasílich, you’ll see to it.
Just unload one or two carts.
Well, what of it...
do what’s necessary...
said the count, muttering some indefinite order.
The count looked around him.
Please step into the gallery, your excellency, said the major-domo.
The countess sent for her husband.
You know, love, I wanted to tell you...
You know, I think, my dear...
let them be taken...
That’s what other people do.
It’s only we who are such fools.
But I heard, said Natásha.
Natásha stepped up to the window and pondered.
Health, at a time like this? said the count.
No one knows what is coming.
yes, those exploits of antique valor, he went on rapidly.
Our corps was stationed on a hillside.
I have just been told that nothing is ready yet.
Somebody after all must see to things.
One misses Mítenka at such times.
There won’t be any end to it.
said the count, and stopped.
I wish to give her a surprise, you see.
The count frowned and coughed.
Ask the countess, I don’t give orders.
If it’s inconvenient, please don’t, said Berg.
Only I so wanted it, for dear Véra’s sake.
cried the old count.
My head’s in a whirl! And he left the room.
The countess began to cry.
Yes, Mamma! Yes, these are very hard times! said Berg.
The loaded carts were still standing in the yard.
Do you know what it’s about? Pétya asked Natásha.
She did not answer.
Vasílich told me.
I don’t know what.
It’s horrid! It’s abominable! she screamed.
The count stood still at the window and listened.
They will be left!...
No, Mamma darling, it’s not the thing.
Please forgive me, darling....
My dear, you order what is right....
Papa! Mamma! May I see to it? May I?...
We will still take all the most necessary things.
We can take four more men, said the steward.
Dunyásha can go with me in the carriage.
The whole household, servants included, was bright and animated.
We must keep at least one cart.
What’s in it? asked Natásha.
The count’s books.
Leave it, Vasílich will put it away.
It’s not wanted.
On the box.
You’ll sit on the box, won’t you, Pétya? cried Natásha.
Why, didn’t you know, Miss? replied the maid.
Natásha was not in the room.
Mamma, said Sónya, Prince Andrew is here, mortally wounded.
He is going with us.
Natásha? she murmured.
You say he is dying? Sónya nodded.
Well, Mamma? Everything is ready.
Nothing, answered the countess.
If everything is ready let us start.
Sónya embraced Natásha and kissed her.
Natásha looked at her inquiringly.
What is it? What has happened? Nothing...
Sónya sighed and made no reply.
All the others did the same.
They always will forget everything! said the countess.
Oh, those servants! said the count, swaying his head.
Then Efím deliberately doffed his hat and began crossing himself.
The postilion and all the other servants did the same.
Off, in God’s name! said Efím, putting on his hat.
She knew it was right in front.
Really, said Natásha, look, look! No, it’s not he.
Are you remaining in Moscow, then? Pierre hesitated.
In Moscow? he said in a questioning tone.
Yes, in Moscow.
How splendid! said Natásha.
You were at the battle, we heard.
Yes, I was, Pierre answered.
There will be another battle tomorrow...
he began, but Natásha interrupted him.
But no! Good-by, good-by! he muttered.
This is how it happened.
Oh, yes, in a minute; wait...
or no! No, of course...
There was no one in the passage.
The hall porter was standing at the front door.
He went down that staircase and out into the yard.
No one had seen him.
He went up to the gate.
At home? asked Pierre.
Be so good as to step in.
Yes, yes, I know.
Let us go in...
said Pierre and entered the house.
Will you step into the study? Pierre nodded.
Yes, your excellency, replied Gerásim.
Yes, your excellency, said Gerásim after thinking for a moment.
The brightness of the morning was magical.
Cette ville asiatique aux innombrables églises, Moscou la sainte.
It was high time.
But could it be otherwise? he thought.
Here is this capital at my feet.
I must be magnanimous and truly great.
But I shall spare her.
Qu’on m’amène les boyars, * said he to his suite.
* Bring the boyars to me.
Two hours passed.
* My dear, my tender, my poor mother.
* (2) House of my Mother.
But it’s impossible...
CHAPTER XX Meanwhile Moscow was empty.
They do not sting, but crawl away from danger.
All is neglected and foul.
They reek of decay and death.
My carriage! he said.
Moscow deserted! he said to himself.
The coup de théâtre had not come off.
A third officer galloped up to them.
This is outrageous! Half the men have dispersed.
Where are you off to?...
There is no getting them together.
Some soldiers started running away in a group.
Your honor! said he.
Several shopkeepers crowded round the officer.
The officer stood perplexed and his face showed indecision.
The officer mounted his horse and rode after him.
Four borzois with collars were pressing close to the wheels.
CHAPTER XXII Meanwhile, the city itself was deserted.
There was hardly anyone in the streets.
Nobody drove through the streets and footsteps were rarely heard.
The Povarskáya was quite still and deserted.
Aunt, I did it gently, said the boy.
Go and get the samovar to boil for your grandfather.
Mávra Kuzmínichna went to the gate.
Who do you want? The count—Count Ilyá Andréevich Rostóv.
They have gone away, sir.
Went away yesterday at vespertime, said Mávra Kuzmínichna cordially.
Ah, how annoying! he muttered.
I should have come yesterday....
Ah, what a pity.
He again paused in indecision.
Mávra Kuzmínichna did not let him finish.
Just wait a minute, sir.
One little moment, said she.
but as it is...
Mávra Kuzmínichna grew abashed and confused.
If the count had been at home...
Mávra Kuzmínichna went on apologetically.
The tall lad waved his arm.
Stop it! he exclaimed peremptorily.
The factory hands followed him.
screamed a woman coming out of a gate close by.
A crowd gathered round the bloodstained smith.
Murderer! he shouted suddenly to the publican.
The bloodstained smith went beside them.
The factory hands and others followed behind, talking and shouting.
Questions and answers were heard.
Why talk nonsense? rejoined voices in the crowd.
We too will take part...
We will do, completely do, and undo these scoundrels.
The tall lad hung his head gloomily.
They all stood despondent and silent.
We should ask him...
that’s he himself?...
Yes, ask him indeed!...
Why not? He’ll explain...
What people are these? he shouted again, receiving no answer.
Go on! he ordered his coachman.
This was not news to Rostopchín.
The inhabitants left against his wishes.
Not I, of course.
I had everything ready.
I had Moscow firmly in hand.
asking for information....
from the superintendent of the lunatic asylum...
And let the lunatics out into the town.
Vereshchágin! Hasn’t he been hanged yet? shouted Rostopchín.
Rostopchín felt this, and it was this which exasperated him.
The blood-stained smith stood beside him with a gloomy face.
A drone of voices was audible through the closed window.
It is, your excellency, replied the adjutant.
Rostopchín went again to the balcony door.
Your excellency, I venture to suggest...
You may go.
He stood by the balcony door looking at the crowd.
Is the carriage ready? he asked again.
Yes, your excellency.
Ah! exclaimed Rostopchín, as if struck by an unexpected recollection.
Good morning, lads! said the count briskly and loudly.
Thank you for coming.
A murmur of approbation and satisfaction ran through the crowd.
The crowd moved eagerly from the balcony toward the porch.
Where is he? he inquired.
Put him there.
Lads! said he, with a metallic ring in his voice.
But Rostopchín did not look at him.
All eyes were fixed on him.
Cut him down.
I command it.
He did not finish what he wished to say.
Cut him down! I command it...
shouted Rostopchín, suddenly growing pale like Vereshchágin.
Draw sabers! cried the dragoon officer, drawing his own.
Saber him! the dragoon officer almost whispered.
O Lord! exclaimed a sorrowful voice.
The crime had begun and must now be completed.
The dragoon was about to repeat his blow.
Hit him with an ax, eh!...
Traitor, he sold Christ....
serves him right! Torture serves a thief right.
Use the hatchet!...
Quite a young fellow too...
must have been a merchant’s son.
and they say he’s not the right one....
How not the right one?...
Oh, the people...
Aren’t they afraid of sinning?...
The crowd shrank back from it.
This way, your excellency...
Where are you going?...
This way, please...
said a trembling, frightened voice behind him.
At the back entrance stood his calèche.
The mob is terrible—disgusting, he said to himself in French.
They are like wolves whom nothing but flesh can appease.
I had other duties, thought he.
The people had to be appeased.
The thought which tranquillized Rostopchín was not a new one.
And Rostopchín now knew it.
The Sokólniki field was deserted.
Coming abreast of the calèche he ran beside it.
They stoned me, crucified me...
I shall rise...
They have torn my body.
The kingdom of God will be overthrown...
He turned away.
faster! he cried in a trembling voice to his coachman.
I need not have said them, he thought.
And then nothing would have happened.
But I did not do it for my own sake.
I was bound to act that way....
The mob, the traitor...
the public welfare, thought he.
Troops were still crowding at the Yaúza bridge.
It was hot.
It was Count Rostopchín.
Rostopchín grew confused and became silent.
An interpreter rode up to the group.
Take off your cap...
They imagined it to be a call to arms.
A few infantrymen ran to the Kutáfyev Gate.
The sound of three more shots came from the gate.
And all made ready for that battle.
The cries from the gates ceased.
He grasped a musket and took aim at the French.
The gate was again hidden by smoke.
In the gateway lay three wounded and four dead.
Who these men were nobody knew.
Murat was informed that the way had been cleared.
And Moscow engulfed the army ever deeper and deeper.
* To Rostopchín’s ferocious patriotism.
He was completely obsessed by one persistent thought.
Two equally strong feelings drew Pierre irresistibly to this purpose.
It was two o’clock in the afternoon.
The French had already entered Moscow.
Yes, I will approach...
and then suddenly...
His dressing gown was unfastened, his face red and distorted.
He was obviously drunk.
They’re frightened, he said confidentially in a hoarse voice.
I say I won’t surrender, I say...
That will do, please, that will do.
Have the goodness—please, sir, to let go! Please, sir...
Who are you? Bonaparte!...
shouted Makár Alexéevich.
That’s not right, sir.
Come to your room, please, and rest.
Allow me to have the pistol.
Board them! Catch hold! whispered Gerásim to the porter.
There were two of them.
* Good day, everybody! No one gave any reply.
Vous êtes le bourgeois? * the officer asked Gerásim.
Les français sont de bons enfants.
Pierre moved away from the door.
* Quarters, quarters, lodgings! The French are good fellows.
Master, not here—don’t understand...
The Frenchman turned pale and rushed to the door.
You are not wounded? he asked.
I think not, answered the Frenchman, feeling himself over.
Who is that man? said he, looking sternly at Pierre.
For a few seconds he looked at him in silence.
You have saved my life.
You are French, said he.
For a Frenchman that deduction was indubitable.
I am Russian, he said quickly.
You shall tell me all about that presently.
I am delighted to meet a compatriot.
You have saved my life! You are French.
You ask his pardon? I grant it you.
A Frenchman never forgets either an insult or a service.
I offer you my friendship.
That is all I can say.
Oh, please! said he.
I understand your reasons.
You are an officer...
a superior officer perhaps.
You have borne arms against us.
That’s not my business.
I owe you my life.
That is enough for me.
I am quite at your service.
Pierre bent his head.
Your baptismal name, if you please.
That is all I ask.
Monsieur Pierre, you say....
That’s all I want to know.
Pierre was hungry and shared the dinner with pleasure.
You see, I have bullets enough in my body already.
I pity those who did not see it.
I was there, said Pierre.
And you made us pay dear for it.
I was at it three times—sure as I sit here.
What a thing to say! he exclaimed.
But Paris, Paris...
The captain looked at Pierre.
I don’t know what, that...
I have been in Paris.
I spent years there, said Pierre.
Oh yes, one sees that plainly.
A man who doesn’t know Paris is a savage.
You can tell a Parisian two leagues off.
You have been to Paris and have remained Russian.
Well, I don’t esteem you the less for it.
To return to your ladies—I hear they are lovely.
We are feared, but we are loved.
We are nice to know.
And then the Emperor...
he began, but Pierre interrupted him.
I assure you I was his enemy eight years ago.
My father was an emigrant count....
But that man has vanquished me.
He has taken hold of me.
Is he in Moscow? Pierre stammered with a guilty look.
The Frenchman looked at his guilty face and smiled.
His face expressed suffering.
He really was suffering at that moment.
He was tormented by the consciousness of his own weakness.
The pistol, dagger, and peasant coat were ready.
Napoleon was to enter the town next day.
I will go away immediately.
I won’t say another word to him, thought Pierre.
He thought this, but still sat in the same place.
The captain, on the other hand, seemed very cheerful.
He paced up and down the room twice.
The colonel of those Württembergers is delightful, he suddenly said.
He’s a German, but a nice fellow all the same....
But he’s a German.
He sat down facing Pierre.
What is the German for ‘shelter’? Shelter? Pierre repeated.
The German for shelter is Unterkunft.
Unterkunft, Pierre repeated.
Morel! he called out gaily.
Morel brought candles and a bottle of wine.
There now, we’re sad, said he, touching Pierre’s hand.
Can I do anything for you? Dispose of me.
It is for life and death.
Thank you, said Pierre.
Pierre took one of the glasses and emptied it.
Yes, my dear friend, he began, such is fortune’s caprice.
Tiens! said the captain.
Platónic love, clouds...
The night was warm and light.
At the gate stood Gerásim, the cook, and two Frenchmen.
They were looking at the glow seen in the town.
But look here, brothers, there’s another fire! remarked an orderly.
All turned their attention to the glow.
But that’s not Mytíshchi, it’s farther away.
Several men joined the first two.
See how it’s flaring, said one.
What are you staring at, you good-for-nothing?...
I only ran out to get some water, said Míshka.
The glow spread, rising and falling, farther and farther still.
God have mercy....
It’s windy and dry...
said another voice.
Just look! See what it’s doing now.
O Lord! You can even see the crows flying.
His voice was calm and deliberate.
Moscow it is, brothers, said he.
Mother Moscow, the white...
Only Natásha and the countess remained in the room.
Look, Natásha, how dreadfully it is burning! said she.
What’s burning? asked Natásha.
Oh, yes, Moscow.
The count returned and lay down behind the partition.
You are cold.
You are trembling all over.
You’d better lie down, said the countess.
Lie down? All right, I will.
I’ll lie down at once, said Natásha.
Natásha, undress, darling; lie down on my bed.
Natásha knew it was not Prince Andrew who was moaning.
The countess exchanged a look with Sónya.
Come, lie down.
Natásha, you’d better lie in the middle, said Sónya.
I’ll stay here, muttered Natásha.
Then the countess called to Natásha.
Natásha did not answer.
I think she’s asleep, Mamma, said Sónya softly.
Soon after that Natásha heard her mother’s even breathing.
A cock crowed far off and another replied near by.
Natásha sat up.
Sónya, are you asleep? Mamma? she whispered.
No one replied.
The boards of the floor creaked.
The cold she felt refreshed her.
It was dark in there.
In her imagination he was that terrible moaning personified.
But an irresistible impulse drew her forward.
The valet sat up and whispered something.
He smiled and held out his hand to her.
He had regained consciousness that morning.
They gave Prince Andrew some tea.
I don’t want any more.
Is Timókhin here? he asked.
Timókhin crept along the bench to him.
I am here, your excellency.
How’s your wound? Mine, sir? All right.
Couldn’t one get a book? he asked.
What book? The Gospels.
I haven’t one.
What trouble would it be to you? he said.
I have not got one.
The doctor went into the passage to wash his hands.
For just one moment I didn’t look after you...
That was why he asked for a copy of them.
Everybody near him was sleeping.
His mind was not in a normal state.
Most diverse thoughts and images occupied him simultaneously.
But besides this there was something else of importance.
Yes—love, he thought again quite clearly.
Now again I feel that bliss.
What has become of him? Is he alive?...
No, neither death nor anything else can destroy it.
It is the very essence of the soul.
And he understood her feelings, her sufferings, shame, and remorse.
Piti-piti-piti and ti-ti and piti-piti-piti boom! flopped the fly....
Her face was pale and rigid.
Only in the lower part of it something quivered.
You? he said.
Forgive me! I love you, said Prince Andrew.
Forgive...! Forgive what? he asked.
They heard the sound of voices behind them.
What’s this? said the doctor, rising from his bed.
CHAPTER XXXIII On the third of September Pierre awoke late.
That something shameful was his yesterday’s conversation with Captain Ramballe.
Am I not too late? he thought.
Moscow was on fire in several places.
The streets and lanes were deserted.
Pierre shook his head and went on.
Dear people, good Christians, save me, help me, dear friends...
help us, somebody, she muttered between her sobs.
My daughter! My youngest daughter is left behind.
She’s burned! Ooh! Was it for this I nursed you....
Monster! Villain! shouted the woman angrily, suddenly ceasing to weep.
We ran out just as we were....
This is what we have brought away....
We seized the children.
But not Katie! Ooh! O Lord!...
and again she began to sob.
Oh, dear sir! she cried, seizing him by the legs.
My benefactor, set my heart at ease....
Show me the way, show me, I...
I’ll do it, gasped Pierre rapidly.
The whole street was full of clouds of black smoke.
Tongues of flame here and there broke through that cloud.
On ne passe pas! * cried a voice.
* You can’t pass! This way, uncle, cried the girl.
Which is it? Which is your house? he asked.
Ooh! wailed the girl, pointing to the wing.
That’s it, that was our lodging.
He felt young, bright, adroit, and resolute.
Other French soldiers standing below went up to the drawer.
There’s a child in that house.
Haven’t you seen a child? cried Pierre.
A child? shouted a Frenchman from above.
I did hear something squealing in the garden.
Perhaps it’s his brat that the fellow is looking for.
After all, one must be human, you know....
Where is it? Where? said Pierre.
Wait a bit—I’m coming down.
Hurry up, you others! he called out to his comrades.
It’s getting hot.
Pierre, however, seized her and lifted her in his arms.
Pierre took no notice of them.
He glanced at her occasionally with a slight smile.
The Anférovs? No, said the woman.
They left in the morning.
O Lord, have mercy! added the deacon.
Go over that way, they’re there.
The old man was already sitting barefoot.
The soldier fell, got up, and ran away.
Voyons, pas de bêtises! * he cried.
Pierre remembered nothing of what happened after that.
Then he turned to Pierre.
Call the interpreter.
And ask him who he is, he added.
Who are you? asked the interpreter in poor Russian.
You must answer the chief.
I will not tell you who I am.
I am your prisoner—take me! Pierre suddenly replied in French.
Ah, ah! muttered the officer with a frown.
Well then, march! A crowd had collected round the Uhlans.
What does that woman want? asked the officer.
Pierre was as if intoxicated.
What does she want? he murmured.
It was regarded as a model of ecclesiastical, patriotic eloquence.
They say the poor countess is very ill.
The doctor says it is angina pectoris.
and the word angina was repeated with great satisfaction.
The count is pathetic, they say.
She is very unfortunate! added Anna Pávlovna.
He is private physician to the Queen of Spain.
Charming, charming! observed Prince Vasíli.
Everybody looked at him, understanding what he meant.
Prince Hippolyte himself glanced around with amused surprise.
Everyone became silent.
But no one said anything.
Prince Vasíli continued.
It followed that there must have been a victory.
General events involuntarily group themselves around some particular incident.
It was like a successfully arranged surprise.
He writes that he is regretfully abandoning Moscow.
* Though a foreigner, Russian in heart and soul.
*(2) * Our most gracious sovereign.
* (2) Whose flames illumined his route.
Though the source of M.
The abandonment of Moscow.
The Emperor listened in silence, not looking at Michaud.
Has the enemy entered the city? he asked.
Yes, sire, and Moscow is now in ashes.
But this lasted only a moment.
Colonel, I always require it, replied the Emperor.
How is that? the Emperor interrupted him, frowning sternly.
Would misfortune make my Russians lose heart?...
You set me at ease, Colonel.
He bent his head and was silent for some time.
Napoleon or I, said the Emperor, touching his breast.
We can no longer both reign together.
And the Emperor paused, with a frown.
But it was not really so.
If he tries to realize it his efforts are fruitless.
The Italian was, as it were, a war trophy.
His particularly free manner of dancing even surprised them all.
Which lady? A charming lady, a divine one.
The husband smiled gloomily, the wife gaily.
Who is she? Anna Ignátyevna Malvíntseva.
She has heard from her niece how you rescued her....
Her niece, Princess Bolkónskaya.
She is here in Vorónezh with her aunt.
Oho! How you blush.
Pray come and see me.
Nicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed.
I will make a match for you with the princess.
One is sorry for the husband, really....
She will really begin to arrange a match...
But see here, to tell the truth, Aunt...
Oh yes, I understand, said the governor’s wife.
But Princess Bolkónskaya—that’s another matter.
I will tell you the truth.
and then everything...
So you see...
The governor’s wife pressed his elbow gratefully.
No, my dear, you and Sónya ought to understand that.
Nicholas remained silent.
It comforted him to hear these arguments.
What a matchmaker you are, Aunt...
said Nicholas, kissing her plump little hand.
She was sad.
And above all, what tact and grace! thought Mademoiselle Bourienne.
From the time Rostóv entered, her face became suddenly transformed.
Their conversation was very simple and unimportant.
And he knew that he would never act basely.
If he tried, his pictures seemed incongruous and false.
It made him afraid.
Nicholas looked at her face with surprise.
We must hope for the best, and I am sure...
Princess Mary interrupted him.
Oh, that would be so dread...
She must be a wonderful woman.
A real angel! he said to himself.
He tried to picture what would happen were he free.
But no, he could not imagine that.
How she prayed! he thought.
What do I want? To be free, released from Sónya...
Muddles, grief for Mamma...
From the governor, said Lavrúshka in a sleepy voice.
A courier has arrived and there’s a letter for you.
Well, all right, thanks.
He recognized them by the handwriting and opened Sónya’s first.
No, it’s not possible! he cried aloud.
Sónya and Natásha were nursing him.
To sacrifice herself for others was Sónya’s habit.
She heard the sound of their voices through the door.
That door opened and Natásha came out, looking excited.
Natásha, what are you about? Come here! said the countess.
Sónya, will he live? she asked.
Sónya, how happy I am, and how unhappy!...
Sónya, dovey, everything is as it used to be.
If only he lives! He cannot...
and Natásha burst into tears.
Yes! I knew it! Thank God! murmured Sónya.
He will live.
Sobbing, she kissed and comforted Natásha.
If only he lives! she thought.
Prince Andrew was lying raised high on three pillows.
What? What is it? asked Natásha.
It’s that, that...
said Sónya, with a white face and trembling lips.
You remember, said Sónya with a solemn and frightened expression.
You remember when I looked in the mirror for you...
You remember? Sónya went on.
I saw it then and told everybody, you and Dunyásha.
But what does it mean? she added meditatively.
Yes, Mamma, I will write, said she.
Pierre felt sad at hearing them making fun of him.
It was evident that any answer would lead to conviction.
They interrupted him, for this was not to the point.
Again he replied that he could not answer it.
Put that down, that’s bad...
Fires were visible on all sides.
Pierre was the sixth to enter.
So he was silent.
You cannot know me, General, I have never seen you...
Davout turned away.
No, monseigneur, you cannot have known me.
I am a militia officer and have not quitted Moscow.
Your name? asked Davout.
Davout looked up and gazed intently at him.
He reflected for a moment.
You are not what you say, returned Davout.
It seemed that he had quite forgotten Pierre.
It was a system—a concurrence of circumstances.
He lost the power of thinking or understanding.
He could only hear and see.
Pierre looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized them.
The two first were convicts with shaven heads.
Two more prisoners were led up.
Sharpshooters of the 86th, forward! shouted someone.
Pierre ran up to the post.
No one hindered him.
Pale, frightened people were doing something around the workman.
The body collapsed.
All but one rejoined their companies.
The crowd of Russians and Frenchmen began to disperse.
They all went away silently and with drooping heads.
In the darkness some twenty different men surrounded Pierre.
They were telling him something and asking him something.
Well, then, mates...
that very prince who...
And here we live, thank heaven, without offense.
So you’ve come, you rascal? She remembers...
In his hands he had something wrapped in a rag.
He thanked the soldier and began to eat.
You should do like this.
The potatoes are grand! he said once more.
Tss, tt...! said the little man.
Ah, what a sin...
I stayed accidentally, replied Pierre.
Where there’s law there’s injustice, put in the little man.
I was dying of fever.
We weren’t told anything.
There were some twenty of us lying there.
We had no idea, never guessed at all.
And do you feel sad here? Pierre inquired.
They call me ‘little falcon’ in the regiment.
What? What did you say? asked Pierre.
Who? I? said Karatáev.
Well, and have you little ones? he went on asking.
The great thing is to live in harmony....
We lived well.
We were real peasants.
It so happened...
That’s how it is, dear fellow.
Fate looks for a head.
And Platón shifted his seat on the straw.
After a short silence he rose.
That’s the way.
What prayer was that you were saying? asked Pierre.
Eh? murmured Platón, who had almost fallen asleep.
What was I saying? I was praying.
Don’t you pray? Yes, I do, said Pierre.
One must pity the animals too.
He could do everything, not very well but not badly.
He baked, cooked, sewed, planed, and mended boots.
A soldier on leave—a shirt outside breeches, he would say.
Platón Karatáev knew nothing by heart except his prayers.
In a few days Princess Mary was ready to start.
Her love for Rostóv no longer tormented or agitated her.
How is the prince? she asked.
His excellency is staying in the same house with them.
The carriage steps clattered as they were let down.
The carriage door was opened.
(This was Sónya.) Princess Mary ran up the steps.
This was the countess.
She embraced Princess Mary and kissed her.
Where is he? she asked again, addressing them all.
He is downstairs.
Natásha is with him, answered Sónya, flushing.
We have sent to ask.
I think you must be tired, Princess.
Tears of vexation showed themselves in Princess Mary’s eyes.
she began her question but stopped short.
Princess Mary understood.
will see, was all Natásha could say.
That danger had also passed.
Is he weaker? Thinner? asked the princess.
No, it’s not that, but worse.
You will see.
He was thin and pale.
His eyes gazed at them as they entered.
But in what am I to blame? she asked herself.
* * Thank you for coming, my dear.
Princess Mary pressed his hand.
The pressure made him wince just perceptibly.
She looks after me all the time.
The conversation was cold and disconnected and continually broke off.
Mary came by way of Ryazán, said Natásha.
Really? he asked.
It was impossible to talk.
Yes, they say it’s burned, he said.
Natásha, who felt her glance, did not look at her.
All three were again silent.
Andrew, would you like...
Yes, I shall be very glad to see him.
He looked at her attentively.
Is it about Nicholas? he asked.
Princess Mary nodded her head, weeping.
Mary, you know the Gosp...
but he broke off.
What did you say? Nothing.
Yes, to them it must seem sad! he thought.
But how simple it is.
We cannot understand one another, and he remained silent.
Prince Andrew’s little son was seven.
He could scarcely read, and knew nothing.
Without haste or agitation he awaited what was coming.
Formerly he had feared the end.
And joyful and agitating thoughts began to occupy his mind.
And he dared not inquire.
It was evening.
Sónya was sitting by the table.
He began to doze.
Suddenly a feeling of happiness seized him.
Ah, she has come! thought he.
She moved, and the ball rolled off her knees.
I felt you come in.
I want to weep for joy.
Natásha drew closer to him.
Her face shone with rapturous joy.
And I!—She turned away for an instant.
Why too much? she asked.
Why too much?...
He remained silent awhile.
But you have not slept, she said, repressing her joy.
Try to sleep...
Soon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep.
He felt himself nearer to it.
Love? What is love? he thought.
Love hinders death.
Love is life.
Everything is, everything exists, only because I love.
Everything is united by it alone.
These thoughts seemed to him comforting.
But they were only thoughts.
And there was the former agitation and obscurity.
He fell asleep.
Many various, indifferent, and insignificant people appeared before him.
He talked to them and discussed something trivial.
They were preparing to go away somewhere.
He was seized by an agonizing fear.
And that fear was the fear of death.
It stood behind the door.
Once again it pushed from outside.
It entered, and it was death, and Prince Andrew died.
Yes, it was death! I died—and woke up.
Where has he gone? Where is he now?...
Suddenly the beast was heard to moan.
Such is the present spirit of my nation.
Another corps of several thousand men is moving on Dmítrov.
Napoleon himself was in Moscow as late as the twenty-fifth.
You have experienced my readiness to reward you.
A cornet, hearing the story, informed his commander.
The Cossack was sent for and questioned.
All right—all right.
The dispositions drawn up by Toll were very good.
Gone away, said Ermólov’s orderly.
No, and the general’s out too.
The officer, mounting his horse, rode off to someone else.
No, he’s gone out.
In the meadows...
It was already past eight o’clock.
Groups of singers stood outside the windows.
It was a trick.
It was done on purpose to get Konovnítsyn into trouble.
You’ll see what a mess there’ll be tomorrow.
But all was still quiet.
A damp dull autumn morning was just dawning.
He sent for an officer.
How! Not rec...
He was suffering physically.
And once more Kutúzov had to consent.
Count Orlóv-Denísov consulted his fellow officers.
The offer was too tempting to be refused.
Everyone volunteered to go and everybody advised making the attempt.
It will be too late.
It is quite light.
And the adjutant galloped through the forest after Grékov.
All his men felt the same excitement.
Mount! he commanded in a whisper.
The men took their places and crossed themselves....
That was what the officers desired.
None of them listened to orders.
He did not advance.
That is an essential condition.
The Russians retreat and abandon their ancient capital.
Napoleon’s position is most brilliant.
With regard to administrative matters, Moscow was granted a constitution.
* As looters.
(5) Steps will immediately be taken to re-establish ordinary trading.
Even philanthropy did not have the desired effect.
The French, collecting booty, cared only for gold.
Robbery and pillaging continue.
But it did not go away.
Everything pleased it.
Physically he had changed much during this time.
His feet were bare.
To be on the march in such weather...
He is a man who never forgets anything.
Thomas,’ he said to me the other day.
‘Monsieur Kiril is a man of education, who speaks French.
He knows what’s what....
And after chatting a while longer, the corporal went away.
None of the prisoners said a word.
You’ll be nice and comfortable....
Thanks, thanks, old fellow....
But give me the pieces that are over.
What does he want the bits for? said Karatáev.
They’d make fine leg bands for us.
Well, never mind.
Oh dear! muttered Karatáev and went away.
There, look at that, said Karatáev, swaying his head.
But Pierre believed it without any mental reservation.
And Pierre felt that their opinion placed responsibilities upon him.
You may be better off than we others, said Pierre.
The corporal came, according to orders, to shut the door.
The prisoners had to be counted before being let out.
Corporal, what will they do with the sick man?...
There it is!...
Pierre knew this now.
One had to wait and endure.
Pierre told him about the sick man.
He’ll manage to walk, devil take him! said the captain.
Pass on, pass on! he continued without looking at Pierre.
But he is dying, Pierre again began.
Be so good...
shouted the captain, frowning angrily.
What are you disputing about? said the major angrily.
What does it matter whether it is St.
Nicholas or St.
All beyond the river, and Zúbova, and in the Krémlin....
Just look! There’s not half of it left.
Go on! What the devil...
Go on! Thirty thousand devils!...
What crowds! Just look at the crowds!...
Just see what the blackguards have looted....
There! See what that one has behind in the cart....
Why, those are settings taken from some icons, by heaven!...
Oh, the rascals!...
See that fellow there sitting on the trunks....
Heavens! They’re fighting.
Look, look there....
Why, that must be Napoleon’s own.
That fellow’s dropped his sack and doesn’t see it.
Just look, there’s no end to it.
The women’s vehicles drove by.
They all appeared angry and dissatisfied.
The sun had set long since.
Bright stars shone out here and there in the sky.
It grew light.
He wanted to talk to them.
Ha-ha-ha! laughed Pierre.
They took me and shut me up.
They hold me captive.
What, me? Me? My immortal soul? Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!...
and he laughed till tears started to his eyes.
High up in the light sky hung the full moon.
The soldiers and officers again demanded action.
Kutúzov did not consider any offensive necessary.
He had been ordered to attack Formínsk.
CHAPTER XVI It was a warm, dark, autumn night.
It had been raining for four days.
You should wake the captain first.
Your honor, your honor! A courier.
What? What’s that? From whom? came a sleepy voice.
From Dokhtúrov and from Alexéy Petróvich.
The man who had wakened yawned and stretched himself.
I don’t like waking him, he said, fumbling for something.
He is very ill.
Perhaps this is only a rumor.
Here is the dispatch, said Bolkhovítinov.
Wait a moment, I’ll light a candle.
Oh, the nasty beasts! said he with disgust.
This was Konovnítsyn.
Who gave the report? inquired Shcherbínin, taking the envelope.
The news is reliable, said Bolkhovítinov.
Prisoners, Cossacks, and the scouts all say the same thing.
Peter Petróvich! said he.
That did not interest him.
Patience and time are my warriors, my champions, thought Kutúzov.
But that’s not what is needed now.
But the contingencies are endless.
On the one hand the French had occupied Moscow.
The longer he thought the more contingencies presented themselves.
This question absorbed all his mental powers.
All else was to him only life’s customary routine.
There can be no doubt about it, your Highness.
Call him in, call him here.
Speak quicker, quicker! Don’t torture me! Kutúzov interrupted him.
Bolkhovítinov told him everything and was then silent, awaiting instructions.
Toll was beginning to say something but Kutúzov checked him.
O Lord, my Creator, Thou has heard our prayer...
said he in a tremulous voice with folded hands.
Russia is saved.
I thank Thee, O Lord! and he wept.
It was what the French called le hourra de l’Empereur.
A lump of snow cannot be melted instantaneously.
Of the Russian commanders Kutúzov alone understood this.
All Napoleon’s wars serve to confirm this rule.
Les gros bataillons ont toujours raison.
* * Large battalions are always victorious.
Consequently x/y = 15/4.
The irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal.
Others consisted solely of Cossack cavalry.
They reckoned that the convoy had fifteen hundred men.
CHAPTER IV It was a warm rainy autumn day.
* A captain of Cossacks.
This was the French drummer boy captured that morning.
Their necks, with their wet, close-clinging manes, looked strangely thin.
Steam rose from them.
There’s someone coming, said he.
The esaul looked in the direction Denísov indicated.
There are two, an officer and a Cossack.
Behind him, standing in the stirrups, trotted a Cossack.
From the general, said the officer.
Please excuse its not being quite dry.
Denísov, frowning, took the envelope and opened it.
But Komaróv and I—he pointed to the Cossack—were prepared.
We have each of us two pistols....
But what’s this? he asked, noticing the French drummer boy.
The officer was Pétya Rostóv.
He—he indicated Pétya—is serving under him.
But can you stay till tomowwow? Oh, please...
May I stay with you? cried Pétya.
He gave me no instructions.
I think I could? he returned, inquiringly.
Well, all wight, said Denísov.
Denísov and Pétya rode up to him.
It is a very suitable spot, said the esaul.
We’ll send the infantwy down by the swamps, Denísov continued.
And at the signal shot...
The hollow is impassable—there’s a swamp there, said the esaul.
The horses would sink.
We must ride round more to the left....
For a moment Denísov and the esaul drew back.
But the firing and shouting did not relate to them.
The French were evidently firing and shouting at him.
Why, that’s our Tíkhon, said the esaul.
So it is! It is! The wascal! said Denísov.
He’ll get away! said the esaul, screwing up his eyes.
The French who had been pursuing him stopped.
Smart, that! said the esaul.
He’s our plastún.
He was a peasant from Pokróvsk, near the river Gzhat.
Denísov gave orders to let him do so.
In Denísov’s party he held a peculiar and exceptional position.
It was Tíkhon.
Well, where did you disappear to? inquired Denísov.
I took him into the forest.
He starts yelling, and suddenly there were four of them.
They rushed at me with their little swords.
Don’t play the fool! said Denísov, coughing angrily.
Oh, but he was a regular good-for-nothing, said Tíkhon.
You are a bwute! said Denísov.
I wanted to question...
But I questioned him, said Tíkhon.
He said he didn’t know much.
But this uneasiness lasted only a moment.
Only do let me into the very...
into the chief...
I don’t want a reward....
But I want...
Into the vewy chief...
Denísov repeated with a smile.
Pétya went on.
What would it be to you?...
And he handed him his clasp knife.
The officer admired it.
Please keep it.
I have several like it, said Pétya, blushing.
Heavens! I was quite forgetting! he suddenly cried.
I have some raisins, fine ones; you know, seedless ones.
I bought ten pounds.
I am used to something sweet.
Would you like some?...
And he’s very honest, that’s the chief thing.
I’ll be sure to send it to you.
I bought them very cheap.
Will it seem odd if I ask? Pétya thought.
Call him in.
His name is Vincent Bosse.
Have him fetched.
I’ll call him, said Pétya.
Yes, yes, call him.
A poor little fellow, Denísov repeated.
Pétya was standing at the door when Denísov said this.
Bosse! Vincent! Pétya cried, stopping outside the door.
Ah, Vesénny? said a Cossack.
He is warming himself there by the bonfire.
He’s a smart lad, said an hussar standing near Pétya.
We gave him something to eat a while ago.
Ah, c’est vous! said Pétya.
* (2) Come in, come in.
* Thank you, sir.
He stood irresolutely beside him in the passage.
Come in, come in! he repeated in a gentle whisper.
Dólokhov’s appearance amazed Pétya by its simplicity.
It will be necessary to go there.
I like to work accurately.
I’ll go with you! cried Pétya.
I like that! exclaimed Pétya.
Why shouldn’t I go? Because it’s useless.
Well, you must excuse me, because...
I shall go, and that’s all.
You’ll take me, won’t you? he said, turning to Dólokhov.
He was taken today but he knows nothing.
I’m keeping him with me.
Yes, and where do you put the others? inquired Dólokhov.
The rest either starve or get killed.
That’s not the point.
I’m not going to discuss the matter.
I do not wish to take it on my conscience.
You say they’ll die.
Only not by my fault! Dólokhov began laughing.
However, we must get to work.
Tell the Cossack to fetch my kit.
I have two French uniforms in it.
Well, are you coming with me? he asked Pétya.
I will certainly go to the French camp with Dólokhov.
It will only make things worse....
* Lancers of the 6th Regiment.
The black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridge.
* * Password.
Dólokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walk.
Dites donc, le colonel Gérard est ici? * he asked.
Je vous demande si le colonel est ici.
I am asking you if the colonel is here.
Bonjour, messieurs! * said Dólokhov loudly and clearly.
* Good day, gentlemen.
Is that you, Clément? he asked.
For some seconds all were silent.
No one replied.
The horses were brought.
Good evening, gentlemen, said Dólokhov.
The officers were whispering together.
At one spot he stopped and listened.
Do you hear? he asked.
Well now, good-by.
Thank God! he exclaimed.
Yes, thank God! he repeated, listening to Pétya’s rapturous account.
Now lie down.
We can still get a nap before morning.
no, said Pétya, I don’t want to sleep yet.
Besides I know myself, if I fall asleep it’s finished.
It was still quite dark outside.
Well, you should get some sleep now, said the Cossack.
No, I am used to this, said Pétya.
Don’t you want any? You can have some.
Because I am accustomed to doing everything accurately, said Pétya.
I don’t like that.
Just so, said the Cossack.
He climbed onto the wagon and sat on its edge.
The Cossack was sharpening the saber under the wagon.
I say! Are the lads asleep? asked Pétya.
Some are, and some aren’t—like us.
Fast asleep after his fright.
Why, this gentleman’s saber.
He was in a fairy kingdom where nothing resembled reality.
Nothing Pétya could have seen now would have surprised him.
He was in a fairy kingdom where everything was possible.
He looked up at the sky.
And the sky was a fairy realm like the earth.
Sometimes it seemed as if the black spaces were clouds.
Pétya’s eyes began to close and he swayed a little.
The trees were dripping.
Quiet talking was heard.
The horses neighed and jostled one another.
The music became more and more audible.
The melody grew and passed from one instrument to another.
It’s in my ears.
But perhaps it’s music of my own.
Well, go on, my music! Now!...
He tried to conduct that enormous orchestra.
Now softly, softly die away! and the sounds obeyed him.
Now fuller, more joyful.
Now voices join in! ordered Pétya.
He was awakened by Likhachëv’s kindly voice.
It’s getting light, it’s really getting light! he exclaimed.
And here’s the commander, said Likhachëv.
Denísov stood by the watchman’s hut giving final orders.
The esaul gave some orders to his men.
Well, is ev’wything weady? asked Denísov.
Bwing the horses.
The horses were brought.
Pétya put his foot in the stirrup.
Vasíli Dmítrich, entrust me with some commission! Please...
for God’s sake...! said he.
Denísov seemed to have forgotten Pétya’s very existence.
He turned to glance at him.
The signal! said he.
The Cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out.
He galloped to the bridge.
Cossacks were galloping along the road in front of him.
Cossacks were crowding about a hut, busy with something.
From the midst of that crowd terrible screams arose.
He could hear shooting ahead of him.
When Pétya galloped up the Frenchman had already fallen.
A bullet had pierced his skull.
We won’t take them! he called out to Denísov.
I am used to something sweet.
Raisins, fine ones...
take them all! he recalled Pétya’s words.
Behind the prisoners came a cavalry baggage train.
Some of Junot’s wagons also had been captured or abandoned.
The group of prisoners had melted away most of all.
Still less did Pierre think about himself.
Well, how are you? he asked.
Pierre had long been familiar with that story.
A bloodstained knife was found under the old merchant’s pillow.
Only he prayed to God for death.
‘Where did it happen, Daddy?’ he said.
The affair reached the Tsar.
CHAPTER XIV À vos places! * suddenly cried a voice.
* To your places.
The prisoners thronged together and were pushed off the road.
The convoy formed up.
It was one of the marshals.
Their faces all looked excited and worried.
But Pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself.
When the prisoners again went forward Pierre looked round.
And he again started reckoning.
What a stupid beast! Why is it howling? thought Pierre.
The men crowded together round the campfires.
Life is everything.
Life is God.
Everything changes and moves and that movement is God.
To love life is to love God.
Karatáev! came to Pierre’s mind.
This globe was alive—a vibrating ball without fixed dimensions.
That is life, said the old teacher.
How simple and clear it is, thought Pierre.
There now, Karatáev has spread out and disappeared.
Do you understand, my child? said the teacher.
He lifted himself and sat up.
Ah, he’s come? said Pierre.
And Plat— he began, but did not finish.
French soldiers were running past him.
All around he heard his comrades sobbing with joy.
How many? Dólokhov asked the Cossack.
The second hundred, replied the Cossack.
They are almost disbanded.
November 9: twenty miles from Smolénsk.
One army fled and the other pursued.
Greatness, it seems, excludes the standards of right and wrong.
Grand is good, not grand is bad.
* It is great.
* (2) That it is great.
It could not exist because it was senseless and unattainable.
Both avoided any allusion to the future.
His chest is dreadfully hollow and his shoulders raised.
One of his legs twitches just perceptibly, but rapidly.
Natásha knows that he is struggling with terrible pain.
It would be continual torture.
And he looked searchingly at her.
She said: This can’t go on—it won’t.
You will get well—quite well.
He thought it would be dreadful for me.
He then still wished to live and feared death.
I thought quite differently.
Now there is nothing...
thee! I love, love...
about Peter Ilýnich...
a letter, she finished with a sob.
His face was puckered up and wet with tears.
Go, go, she...
Natásha neither saw nor heard her.
Sónya and the maids were holding her arms.
cried the countess.
It’s not true...
it’s not true...
Natásha! she shrieked, pushing those around her away.
Go away, all of you; it’s not true! Killed!...
ha, ha, ha!...
My dearest darling...
Mummy, my precious!...
She did not sleep and did not leave her mother.
The countess was sitting up in bed and speaking softly.
How glad I am you have come.
You are tired.
Won’t you have some tea? Natásha went up to her.
Mamma! What are you saying...
CHAPTER III Princess Mary postponed her departure.
The mother’s wounded spirit could not heal.
Pétya’s death had torn from her half her life.
Natásha’s wound healed in that way.
Love awoke and so did life.
You are tired—try to sleep.
She is much better.
She spoke so well today, said Princess Mary.
Is she like him? thought Natásha.
Yes, like and yet not like.
But she is quite original, strange, new, and unknown.
And she loves me.
What is in her heart? All that is good.
They spoke most of what was long past.
The wound had begun to heal from within.
And as usual nothing happened in accord with the disposition.
* Knight without fear and without reproach.
The Emperor was dissatisfied with him.
* * History of the year 1812.
The day was clear and frosty.
Kutúzov looked long and intently at these two soldiers.
He looked about him absently.
A throng of officers surrounded him.
I thank you all for your hard and faithful service.
He paused and looked around.
Lower, lower, that’s it.
Hur-r-rah! roared thousands of voices.
You see, brothers...
said he when the shouts had ceased...
The Tsar won’t forget your service.
Worse off than our poorest beggars.
They are human beings too.
There was only one hut available for the regimental commander.
The commander rode up to his hut.
Loud, coarse laughter and joyous shouts ensued.
All together! Heave away, boys!...
will you? You may want us one of these days.
Falling? What are you stopping for? There now....
Merry senseless words of abuse flowed freely.
Can’t you make less noise? The men became silent.
Axes and choppers were plied all around.
Everything was done without any orders being given.
The men drew nearer and lit their pipes.
Mother! The dew is cold but clear....
It’s well that I’m a musketeer...
he sang, pretending to hiccough after each syllable.
They’ll soon be issuing us new ones.
Well, he’s a poor sort of soldier....
That’ll do, that’ll do! replied the sergeant major quietly.
The soldier said no more and the talk went on.
They were no more than make-believes.
The Cossacks have taken their boots.
It must be from their food, said the sergeant major.
They used to gobble the same food as the gentry.
No one contradicted him.
And as for the wolves, he says...
That was a real battle, said an old soldier.
It’s the only one worth remembering; but since that...
it’s only been tormenting folk.
‘Pardon!’ they say.
That’s only one case.
They say Plátov took ‘Poleon himself twice.
But he didn’t know the right charm.
And there’s no way of killing him either.
He won’t come here again, remarked the old soldier, yawning.
Look at the stars.
That’s a sign of a good harvest next year.
We shall want some more wood.
You warm your back and your belly gets frozen.
They’re having such fun, said he, coming back.
Two Frenchies have turned up.
One’s quite frozen and the other’s an awful swaggerer.
He’s singing songs....
Oh, I’ll go across and have a look....
A bear, lads, said one of the men.
The soldiers simply held their sides as they watched him.
Vive Henri Quatre! Vive ce roi valiant! sang Morel, winking.
Ce diable à quatre...
Morel, wrinkling up his face, laughed too.
It goes smoothly, too.
Well, now, Zaletáev! Ke...
All the young soldiers smiled gaily as they watched him.
Even wormwood grows on its own root.
They all grew silent.
That impulse was reasonable.
The condition of fugitives and of pursuers was equally bad.
Some Russians even did that, but they were exceptions.
They had heard all that before.
Kutúzov saw this and merely sighed and shrugged his shoulders.
Twice during his career Kutúzov had been governor of Vílna.
Kutúzov made no rejoinder or remark.
Kutúzov seemed not to understand what was expected of him.
It was the Order of St.
George of the First Class.
Kutúzov had received the Order of St.
Toll, Konovnítsyn, and Ermólov received fresh appointments.
And in fact his health was poor.
He could not understand it.
He had what the doctors termed bilious fever.
He was alone in a strange town, without acquaintances.
No one demanded anything of him or sent him anywhere.
Formerly he had sought Him in aims he set himself.
In appearance he was just what he used to be.
They considered that he had become much simpler.
Well, tell me...
now, how did you get food? he would ask.
You are letting yourself go, my dear fellow, he said.
Military, administrative, political, and Masonic interests continually absorbed his attention.
To give or not to give? he had asked himself.
I have it and he needs it.
But someone else needs it still more.
I don’t need all that at all.
By being ruined I have become much richer.
Throughout his journey he felt like a schoolboy on holiday.
All was destroyed, except something intangible yet powerful and indestructible.
They continued what the French had begun.
These forms were lifeless but still existed.
Tradesmen began trading in booths.
Cookshops and taverns were opened in partially burned houses.
Donors contributed Church property that had been stolen.
And Count Rostopchín wrote proclamations.
Perhaps she will see me, said Pierre.
Yes, sir, said the man.
Please step into the portrait gallery.
I was so glad to hear of your safety.
Just imagine—I knew nothing about him! said he.
I thought he had been killed.
All I know I heard at second hand from others.
I only know that he fell in with the Rostóvs....
What a strange coincidence! Pierre spoke rapidly and with animation.
But no, it can’t be! he thought.
It merely reminds me of her.
It suffused him, seized him, and enveloped him completely.
He flushed joyfully yet with painful distress.
He tried to hide his agitation.
No, it’s only the unexpectedness of it, thought Pierre.
They insisted on her coming with me.
You know it happened the very day we were rescued.
I saw him.
remarked Princess Mary.
Yes, yes, that is really true, Pierre hastily interrupted her.
How can you ask why? said Princess Mary.
The thought alone of what awaits...
So he did soften?...
Natásha’s face twitched.
She frowned and lowered her eyes for a moment.
She hesitated for an instant whether to speak or not.
For me it certainly was happiness.
Natásha’s voice broke.
We knew nothing of it when we started from Moscow.
I did not dare to ask about him.
Then suddenly Sónya told me he was traveling with us.
Evidently Natásha needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale.
Several times she repeated the same thing twice.
Well, that’s all—everything, said Natásha.
I will order supper.
Go downstairs, we will come immediately.
They went silently to table.
Now tell us about yourself, said she.
One hears such improbable wonders about you.
Natásha smiled and was on the point of speaking.
And are you building? Yes.
And then such a death...
One was snatched out before my eyes...
he flushed and grew confused.
said Natásha and pausing added, something fine? Pierre continued.
Pierre began to tell about Karatáev, but paused.
Yes, yes, go on! said Natásha.
Where is he? They killed him almost before my eyes.
It was three o’clock in the morning.
Pierre finished his story.
Princess Mary was silent.
While there is life there is happiness.
There is much, much before us.
I say this to you, he added, turning to Natásha.
Yes, yes, she said, answering something quite different.
Pierre looked intently at her.
Yes, and nothing more, said Natásha.
It’s not true, not true! cried Pierre.
What is it, Natásha? said Princess Mary.
She smiled at Pierre through her tears.
Good night! It is time for bed.
Pierre rose and took his leave.
Princess Mary and Natásha met as usual in the bedroom.
They talked of what Pierre had told them.
Well, good night, Mary! said Natásha.
Is it possible to forget? said she.
I am sure he really loved him.
That is why I told him...
Was it all right? she added, suddenly blushing.
To tell Pierre? Oh, yes.
What a splendid man he is! said Princess Mary.
Do you know, Mary...
Isn’t it true? Yes, replied Princess Mary.
He has greatly improved.
Papa used to...
Yes, and yet he is quite different.
They say men are friends when they are quite different.
That must be true.
Really he is quite unlike him—in everything.
Yes, but he’s wonderful.
Well, good night, said Natásha.
Why? But perhaps I shall go.
And your children? The children will live just the same.
With such masters one can live.
But what about my heirs? said Pierre.
Supposing I suddenly marry...
it might happen, he added with an involuntary smile.
How easy he thinks it, thought Pierre.
He doesn’t know how terrible it is and how dangerous.
Too soon or too late...
No, I’ll put it off for a bit.
I’ll tell you later.
No, another time.
Do you know her? asked Pierre.
I have seen the princess, she replied.
It was a great pity.
No, she either doesn’t understand or is pretending, thought Pierre.
Better not say anything to her either.
The princess too had prepared provisions for Pierre’s journey.
How kind they all are, thought Pierre.
What a fine, good-looking officer and how kind.
Pierre went to Princess Mary’s to dinner.
Pierre noticed this but could not go.
So you are going to Petersburg tomorrow? she asked.
to Petersburg? Tomorrow—but I won’t say good-by yet.
Natásha gave him her hand and went out.
He quickly moved an armchair toward Princess Mary.
But I want to be a brother to her.
No, not that, I don’t, I can’t...
This is what I will say.
Princess Mary stopped.
Pierre was looking into Princess Mary’s eyes.
I know that she loves...
will love you, Princess Mary corrected herself.
Write to her parents, and leave it to me.
I will tell her when I can.
Go to Petersburg, that will be best.
And I will write to you, she said.
To Petersburg? Go there? Very well, I’ll go.
No, that’s impossible!...
Good-by, Count, she said aloud.
He did not now make any plans.
Everything ended with that.
Often in afterlife Pierre recalled this period of blissful insanity.
because I was happy.
Everything: her face, walk, look, and voice, was suddenly altered.
He has spoken? Yes? He has spoken? she repeated.
She remembered her brother and his love.
To Petersburg! she repeated as if unable to understand.
Whatever you tell me, I will do.
You love him? Yes, whispered Natásha.
It won’t be just yet—someday.
Let us talk about you.
They were silent awhile.
But no, no, he must...
Yes, Mary, He must....
It was seething in its depths.
They now seemed to rotate on one spot.
Innumerable so-called chances accompany him everywhere.
Again so-called chance accompanies him.
Whatever he does succeeds.
The plague does not touch him.
He is pushed into a meeting of the legislature.
In alarm he wishes to flee, considering himself lost.
And when he is ready so too are the forces.
The invasion pushes eastward and reaches its final goal—Moscow.
Paris, the ultimate goal, is reached.
The Napoleonic government and army are destroyed.
But by some strange chance no one perceives this.
His part is not yet ended.
But the smooth sea again suddenly becomes disturbed.
It rises again from the same point as before—Paris.
That act is performed.
The last rôle is played.
The goal is reached.
I too am a man like the rest of you.
A bee settling on a flower has stung a child.
The arrangements for Natásha’s marriage occupied him for a while.
You don’t meet such men nowadays....
The debts amounted to double the value of the property.
Friends and relations advised Nicholas to decline the inheritance.
Nicholas’ position became worse and worse.
He could see no way out of this situation.
The other way out—his mother’s death—never entered his head.
But I don’t in the least want to, Mamma.
You used to want to, and now you don’t.
Really I don’t understand you, my dear.
But I never said I was dull.
You hide everything from me.
Not at all, Mamma.
One would think mere politeness required it....
Well, then, I’ll go if you wish it.
It doesn’t matter to me.
I only wish it for your sake.
Good-by, Princess! said he.
She started, flushed, and sighed deeply.
but there’s no bringing it back.
I cannot accept your praise, he interrupted her hurriedly.
On the contrary I continually reproach myself....
His face again resumed its former stiff and cold expression.
I had come so near to you...
Thank you, Princess, he added softly.
Sometimes it is hard.
Yes, he is poor now and I am rich....
Yes, that’s the only reason....
Yes, were it not for that...
Why? Tell me.
You must tell me! He was silent.
I confess it.
And that hurts me.
There were tears in her eyes and in her voice.
Princess, for God’s sake! he exclaimed, trying to stop her.
Princess! She turned round.
And Nicholas’ management produced very brilliant results.
He never felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants.
And to do that, order and strictness are essential....
That’s all about it! said he, clenching his vigorous fist.
He was a master...
the peasants’ affairs first and then his own.
Among other things he spoke of the Boguchárovo elder.
Nicholas, I saw it...
he was to blame, but why do you...
Nicholas! and she covered her face with her hands.
Nicholas said nothing.
The tears flowed faster still from the countess’ eyes.
She took his hand and kissed it.
Today—it was the same affair.
Mary, you must despise me! he would say.
I deserve it.
What? asked Countess Mary, surprised.
Sometimes I am dreadfully sorry for her.
She is a sterile flower, you know—like some strawberry blossoms.
The buildings, begun under straitened circumstances, were more than simple.
CHAPTER IX It was the eve of St.
Nicholas, the fifth of December, 1820.
Countess Mary sat at the other end of the table.
She asked him where he had been.
Then I’m not mistaken, thought Countess Mary.
That’s always the way, thought Countess Mary.
He talks to everyone except me.
She did not notice him.
Andrew may wake him.
Sónya went away by another door.
Nicholas suddenly moved and cleared his throat.
She knew how Nicholas disliked being waked.
Nicholas coughed and said no more.
Nicholas turned with a tender smile on his face.
Natásha, Natásha! came Countess Mary’s frightened whisper from the door.
Papa wants to sleep.
Come in, Mary, he said to his wife.
She went in and sat down by her husband.
I did not notice him following me, she said timidly.
I just looked in.
May I kiss Mamma? he asked Natásha.
Natásha smiled bashfully.
It always seems to me...
Mary, don’t talk nonsense.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself! he said gaily.
in this cond...
I don’t know how to put it.
And smoothing his hair he began to pace the room.
He did not care.
Her thoughts were about the children.
You reproach us women with being illogical.
Here is our logic.
But you know you may be unfair.
Yes, but what am I to do?...
I try not to show...
Somebody has come.
I am sure it is Pierre.
Now our Natásha has come to life.
Nicholas went out holding the child by the hand.
Countess Mary remained in the sitting room.
The old fire very rarely kindled in her face now.
She acted in contradiction to all those rules.
Natásha needed a husband.
He was given four weeks’ leave of absence.
and that was unanswerable.
It was more than true.
He’s come, ma’am, whispered the nurse.
The baby again opened his eyes and looked at her.
Natásha ran with light footsteps to the anteroom.
Yes, it is he, happy and contented....
Yes, it’s all very well for you.
You are pleased, you’ve had a good time....
I am nursing and my milk was spoiled....
Pétya was at death’s door.
But you were enjoying yourself.
He made a piteous, frightened face and bent down.
I could not, on my honor.
But how is Pétya? All right now.
And they went to their rooms.
You see, he holds it up.
Yes, just fancy...
At that moment Nicholas and Countess Mary came in.
A lump of flesh.
Now, Pierre nurses them splendidly, said Natásha.
Just look! Only not for this...
Pierre, however, he adored.
So the boy also was happy that Pierre had arrived.
But in time he grew used to this demand.
With a merry, smiling face Pierre was sorting his purchases.
Too dear! Natásha remarked.
Well, let’s go now.
Life gave her no new impressions.
Memento mori, said these glances.
Well, and all this idiocy—Gossner and Tatáwinova? Denísov asked.
Is that weally still going on? Going on? Pierre exclaimed.
What are you saying about the government? I don’t understand.
Evidently some jolly excitement was going on there.
Finished, finished! little Natásha’s gleeful yell rose above them all.
That’s delightful music! said he.
Oh, I’ll go and see, said Pierre, jumping up.
I know! I know that feeling, said Nicholas.
Two, two! they shouted.
Only young Nicholas and his tutor remained.
Dessalles whispered to the boy to come downstairs.
His face expressed entreaty, agitation, and ecstasy.
Countess Mary glanced at him and turned to Pierre.
I will bring him to you directly, Monsieur Dessalles.
You and I haven’t seen anything of one another yet....
What was it about? asked Nicholas.
What can decent men do? Nicholas inquired, frowning slightly.
What can be done? Why, this...
Come into my study, said Nicholas.
Countess Mary followed her.
Well, what would you do? asked Denísov.
Always some fantastic schemes, said Nicholas.
* Without faith or law.
Well, what does that lead up to? said Nicholas.
I told them just one thing in Petersburg.
Prince Theodore and all those.
At that moment Nicholas noticed the presence of his nephew.
His face darkened and he went up to the boy.
That is not enough, I told them.
Something else is needed.
No independent men, such as you or I, are left.
But action with what aim? he cried.
it is what Christ preached on the Cross.
That’s all wight.
Je suis vot’e homme! * * I’m your man.
I can’t prove it to you.
Uncle Pierre, you...
If Papa were alive...
would he agree with you? he asked.
He had, however, to give him an answer.
He flushed and went up to Nicholas.
Uncle, forgive me, I did that...
Nicholas started angrily.
The family separated on the most friendly terms.
What are you writing, Mary? Nicholas asked.
Countess Mary blushed.
It was in French.
He was naughty and obstinate.
I tried threats, but he only grew angrier.
One can do anything with him by tenderness.
What is a ‘ticket’? Nicholas inquired.
Papa said he was to have no pudding.
Must tell Nicholas this.
Nicholas put down the book and looked at his wife.
You weren’t in the study.
We began disputing—Pierre and I—and I lost my temper.
Yes, I know, said Countess Mary.
Natásha told me.
I am sorry you weren’t there.
They all fell on me—Denísov and Natásha...
Natásha is absurd.
Yes, I have noticed that, said Countess Mary.
He is such an exceptional boy.
He is constantly alone with his thoughts.
A wonderful boy, but I am dreadfully afraid for him.
It would be good for him to have companions.
Well it won’t be for long.
Next summer I’ll take him to Petersburg, said Nicholas.
She only took his hand and kissed it.
in an excellent position.
She thought of her nephew.
Nicholas gazed at her.
It was simply dull.
Besides, I was very busy.
Yesterday, for instance, Mítya was naughty...
How like his father he is, Pierre interjected.
You know how much I...
So you say ideas are an amusement to him....
Yes, and for me nothing else is serious.
Which was most delighted? Lisa, I’m sure.
Nicholas says we ought not to think.
But I can’t help it.
We may be mistaken.
Do you know what I am thinking about? she asked.
About Platón Karatáev.
He understood his wife’s line of thought.
He would not have understood...
yet perhaps he would.
I love you awfully! Natásha suddenly said.
What he would have approved of is our family life.
Yes, I should think...
No, it’s not that.
I never leave off loving you.
And one couldn’t love more, but this is something special....
Did you see her? she added, after a pause.
No, and if I had I shouldn’t have recognized her.
They were silent for a while.
You are as like him as two peas—like the boy.
The milk’s come....
But I’m sorry to leave you.
They were silent for a few seconds.
What did you say? Go on, go on.
No, you go on, I was talking nonsense, said Natásha.
Pierre finished what he had begun.
Now that’s simple enough.
And what were you going to say? I? Only nonsense.
I’m sure he thought he was hiding.
Awfully sweet! There, now he’s crying.
Well, good-by! and she left the room.
He had awaked from a terrible dream.
His father caressed and pitied him.
But Uncle Nicholas came nearer and nearer to them.
Terror seized young Nicholas and he awoke.
My father! he thought.
He approved of me and of Uncle Pierre.
Whatever he may tell me, I will do it.
Mucius Scaevola burned his hand.
And I will learn.
I will do better.
Are you ill? he heard Dessalles’ voice asking.
No, answered Nicholas, and lay back on his pillow.
Modern history, in theory, rejects both these principles.
But modern history has not done this.
But modern history cannot give that reply.
Moreover, certain men wrote some books at that time.
They killed the king and many other people.
And there too he killed a great many.
This curious contradiction is not accidental.
They see it in what is called culture—in mental activity.
CHAPTER III A locomotive is moving.
The peasant is irrefutable.
He has devised a complete explanation.
The biographies and special national histories are like paper money.
History proves this at every turn.
What causes historical events? Power.
Napoleon I issues a decree and an army enters Russia.
Men are hauling a log.
He ordered it.
There we have command and power in their primary form.
Electricity produces heat, heat produces electricity.
Atoms attract each other and atoms repel one another.
The same applies to historical events.
Why war and revolution occur we do not know.
But the law of history relates to man.
All seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered this question.
Were it not free it could not be limited.
You say: I am not free.
But I have lifted my hand and let it fall.
(2) His relation to time.
(3) His relation to the causes leading to the action.
I lift my arm and let it fall.
Reason gives expression to the laws of inevitability.
Consciousness gives expression to the essence of freedom.
Inevitability without content is man’s reason in its three forms.
Freedom is the thing examined.
Inevitability is what examines.
Freedom is the content.
Inevitability is the form.
All human sciences have traveled along that path.
History stands on the same path.
